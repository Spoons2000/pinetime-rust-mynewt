[__Flutter is awesome__](https://flutter.dev/) for creating mobile apps for Android and iOS... The programming language is modern [__(Dart)__](https://dart.dev/), the debugging tools are excellent [__(VSCode and Dart DevTools)__](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/tools/vs-code).

That's why we have selected Flutter for creating the open source __[Android and iOS Companion App](https://github.com/lupyuen/pinetime-companion/tree/bloc)__ for __[PineTime Smart Watch](https://lupyuen.github.io/pinetime-rust-mynewt/articles/pinetime)__: For updating firmware, syncing date/time, pushing mobile notifications, controlling our smart home gadgets, ... and so much more!

In the previous article _["Convert Go to Flutter and Dart for PineTime Companion App"](https://lupyuen.github.io/pinetime-rust-mynewt/articles/companion)_ we have built a technically functional (but barely human) app that sends Bluetooth Low Energy commands to PineTime. 

Today we'll recode the app so that it's more human-friendly, like this...

# Why Manage State?

_It's easy to build a mobile app for Android and iOS with Flutter... What could go wrong?_

A mobile app is a simple thing... It just reacts to our tapping and updates the display...

![Mobile app reacts to our tapping and updates the display](https://lupyuen.github.io/images/bloc-state1.png)

_Is it really so simple?_

Nope! Behind the scenes, the app could be calling some REST API on the web. Or talking to Bluetooth gadgets like PineTime...

![Mobile app calls REST API and talks to Bluetooth gadgets](https://lupyuen.github.io/images/bloc-state2.png)

_What happens when the app loses track of its state?_

Things can become really complicated...

![Mobile app gets complicated](https://lupyuen.github.io/images/bloc-state3.png)

There's a good way to handle this messy state in Flutter apps... __[Bloc Library for State Management](https://bloclibrary.dev/)__! 

Read on to learn how.

_(If you're familiar with React Redux: Yep Bloc sounds a lot like React Redux, because they are both State Management Frameworks)_

# Flutter Widgets for PineTime

Our PineTime Companion App calls the __[Bloc Library](https://bloclibrary.dev/)__ to connect our Flutter Widgets with our application data and processing logic. 

Let's look at three Flutter Widgets that we have created for the app...

1. __Device Firmware Widget (Stateless):__ Shows firmware version numbers

1. __Device Summary Widget (Stateless):__ Summarises the PineTime info

1. __Device Widget (Stateful):__ The entire PineTime Companion screen

We'll learn why the widgets are Stateless / Stateful in a while.

## Device Firmware Widget

Our Flutter App talks to PineTime over Bluetooth LE (Low Energy) to fetch the firmware version numbers and display them. Here's how it looks...

![Device Firmware Widget](https://lupyuen.github.io/images/bloc-widgets1.png)

_(PineTime contains two firmware images: Active and Standby. If the Active Firmware fails to start, PineTime rolls back to the Standby Firmware)_

The __Device Firmware Widget__ that displays the firmware version numbers is really simple: [`widgets/device_firmware.dart`](https://github.com/lupyuen/pinetime-companion/blob/bloc/lib/widgets/device_firmware.dart)

```dart
/// Widget to display firmware versions fetched from PineTime
class DeviceFirmware extends StatelessWidget {
  final String activeFirmwareVersion;   //  Version number of firmware that's running on PineTime (e.g. '1.0.0')
  final String standbyFirmwareVersion;  //  Version number of firmware that's in external flash memory (e.g. '1.1.0')

  /// Construct the widget with the active and standby firmware version numbers
  DeviceFirmware({
    Key key,
    this.activeFirmwareVersion,
    this.standbyFirmwareVersion
  }) : super(key: key);

  /// Render the widget UI with two lines of text
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Column(
      children: [
        //  Show active firmware version number
        Text(
          'Active Firmware: $activeFirmwareVersion',
          style: TextStyle(
            fontSize: 16,
            fontWeight: FontWeight.w100,
            color: Colors.white,
          ),
        ),
        //  Show standby firmware version number
        Text(
          'Standby Firmware: $standbyFirmwareVersion',
          style: TextStyle(
            fontSize: 16,
            fontWeight: FontWeight.w100,
            color: Colors.white,
          ),
        )
      ],
    );
  }
}
```

`DeviceFirmware` contains two fields `activeFirmwareVersion` and `standbyFirmwareVersion`, that store the version numbers of the Active and Standby Firmware on PineTime.

`DeviceFirmware` is a [__Stateless Widget__](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/ui/interactive) because its State (`activeFirmwareVersion` and `standbyFirmwareVersion`) doesn't change.

_What happens if PineTime gets updated with new firmware?_

Our Flutter App shall create a new instance of `DeviceFirmware` with new values for `activeFirmwareVersion` and `standbyFirmwareVersion`.

That's why the Device Firmware widget will never change its State... Though the widget may get replaced altogether.

## Device Summary Widget

The Device Firmware widget we've seen is wrapped into a __Device Summary Widget__ like this...

![Device Summary Widget](https://lupyuen.github.io/images/bloc-widgets2.png)

`DeviceSummary` is defined in [`widgets/device_summary.dart`](https://github.com/lupyuen/pinetime-companion/blob/bloc/lib/widgets/device_summary.dart)...

```dart
/// Widget to display PineTime summary
class DeviceSummary extends StatelessWidget {
  /// Data Model that contains PineTime info and Bluetooth device
  final model.Device device;

  /// Render the PineTime summary
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Column(
      children: [
        ...,
        //  Construct a DeviceFirmware Widget to show the firmware versions
        DeviceFirmware(
          activeFirmwareVersion: device.activeFirmwareVersion,
          standbyFirmwareVersion: device.standbyFirmwareVersion,
        )
```

_What's with the Data Model named `Device`?_

```dart
/// Data Model that contains PineTime info and Bluetooth device
final model.Device device;
```

To render the Device Summary, this widget needs to know everything about our PineTime gadget... That's why the widget keeps a copy of the PineTime info inside the __Data Model__ named `Device`.

Note that the Device Summary Widget passes two fields from the `Device` Data Model to the Device Firmware Widget: `activeFirmwareVersion` and `standbyFirmwareVersion`.

`DeviceSummary` is another __Stateless Widget__ that doesn't change its State (i.e. the `Device` Data Model). If the device info changes, our app creates a new `DeviceSummary` widget to replace the old one.

The Data Model is a core concept in the Bloc Library. More about this later.

## Device Widget

The Device Summary Widget above is wrapped into a __Device Widget__ that renders the entire screen...

![Device Widget](https://lupyuen.github.io/images/bloc-widgets3.png)

Device Widget is a [__Stateful Widget__]((https://flutter.dev/docs/development/ui/interactive)) that has some interesting code inside: [`widgets/device.dart`](https://github.com/lupyuen/pinetime-companion/blob/bloc/lib/widgets/device.dart)

```dart
/// Widget for the PineTime Companion screen
class Device extends StatefulWidget {
  /// Construct the Stateful Widget with an initial state
  @override
  State<Device> createState() => _DeviceState();
}

/// Implement the Stateful Widget for the PineTime Companion screen
class _DeviceState extends State<Device> {
  /// Render the PineTime Companion screen
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    //  Render the screen with Button Bar above, followed by the Body
    return Scaffold(
      //  Button Bar for the screen (omitted)
      appBar: ...,

      //  Body for the screen
      body: 
        ...
        //  Construct a BlocConsumer to listen for updates to the state and rebuild the widget
        BlocConsumer<DeviceBloc, DeviceState>(
          //  Listen for updates to the state
          listener: ...,

          //  Rebuild the widget when the state has been updated
          builder: (context, state) {
            //  When we have loaded the device info...
            if (state is DeviceLoadSuccess) {...
              //  Get the device info from the new state
              final device = state.device;

              //  Construct the Device Summary with the device info
              return 
                ...
                DeviceSummary(
                  device: device,
                ),
                ...
```

_Why do we need `createState()` in the Device Widget?_

Device Widget is a [__Stateful Widget__](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/ui/interactive), so it needs to be created with an initial state, like this...

```dart
/// Widget for the PineTime Companion screen
class Device extends StatefulWidget {
  /// Construct the Stateful Widget with an initial state
  @override
  State<Device> createState() => _DeviceState();
```

_Why is the Device Widget Stateful, unlike the other Widgets?_

Because the Device Widget will magically transform itself when something happens!

The code below says that the Device Widget will rebuild its Device Summary Widget when the State has changed to `DeviceLoadSuccess`...

```dart
//  Rebuild the widget when we receive an event
builder: (context, state) {
  //  When we have loaded the device info...
  if (state is DeviceLoadSuccess) {...
    //  Get the device info from the new state
    final device = state.device;

    //  Construct the Device Summary with the device info
    return 
      ...
      DeviceSummary(
        device: device,
      ),
      ...
```

The above [__Bloc Widget Builder__](https://bloclibrary.dev/#/flutterbloccoreconcepts?id=blocbuilder) (exposed by [`BlocConsumer`](https://bloclibrary.dev/#/flutterbloccoreconcepts?id=blocconsumer)) takes the updated `Device` Data Model from the new State, and creates a new Device Summary Widget...

![Rebuilding the Device Summary Widget on state updates](https://lupyuen.github.io/images/bloc-builder.png)

This explains why the Device Widget is Stateful while the Device Summary Widget (and Device Firmware Widget) is Stateless... Because Device Widget will replace the Device Summary Widget when there are updates.

_How do we trigger the `DeviceLoadSuccess` State?_

This State is triggered when we have loaded the device info from PineTime over Bluetooth LE.

That's how widgets get updated in Bloc: The widget listens for State updates and rebuilds itself with a [Bloc Widget Builder](https://bloclibrary.dev/#/flutterbloccoreconcepts?id=blocbuilder).  

We'll see in a while how the `DeviceLoadSuccess` State is generated in Bloc.

_(The code in this article was derived from the excellent [Weather App Tutorial from the Bloc Library](https://bloclibrary.dev/#/flutterweathertutorial))_

# PineTime Data Model

The __Data Model__ is important in Bloc apps... It gets passed to widgets for rendering the user interface. 

Let's look at the Data Model for our PineTime Device, as defined in [`lib/models/device.dart`](https://github.com/lupyuen/pinetime-companion/blob/bloc/lib/models/device.dart)...

```dart
import 'package:equatable/equatable.dart';        //  Object Equality Helper from https://pub.dev/packages/equatable
import 'package:flutter_blue/flutter_blue.dart';  //  Bluetooth LE API from https://github.com/pauldemarco/flutter_blue

/// Data Model for PineTime Device
class Device extends Equatable {
  final BluetoothDevice bluetoothDevice;  //  Bluetooth device for connecting to PineTime, from flutter_blue library
  final String activeFirmwareVersion;     //  Version number of firmware that's running on PineTime (e.g. '1.0.0')
  final String standbyFirmwareVersion;    //  Version number of firmware that's in external flash memory (e.g. '1.1.0')

  /// Constructor for PineTime Device
  const Device({
    this.bluetoothDevice,
    this.activeFirmwareVersion,
    this.standbyFirmwareVersion
  });

  /// Return the properties of PineTime Device
  @override
  List<Object> get props => [
    bluetoothDevice,
    activeFirmwareVersion,
    standbyFirmwareVersion
  ];
}
```

The `Device` Data Model for PineTime contains two fields `activeFirmwareVersion` and `standbyFirmwareVersion`, that store the version numbers of the Active and Standby Firmware on PineTime. 

The two fields are rendered by the Device Firmware Widget that we have seen earlier.

_What's `BluetoothDevice`?_

That's the Bluetooth Device returned by the [`flutter_blue` library for Bluetooth LE networking](https://github.com/pauldemarco/flutter_blue).

In a while we'll see how our Flutter App stores `BluetoothDevice` into the `Device` Data Model. And how our app calls `BluetoothDevice` to send Bluetooth LE requests to PineTime.

To recap, the `Device` Data Model contains everything we know about PineTime, and provides the means to access PineTime (through `BluetoothDevice`).

_Why does `Device` inherit from the `Equatable` class?_

[`Equatable`](https://pub.dev/packages/equatable) is a helper library that lets us compare two objects for equality.

Two `Device` Data Models are deemed equivalent if the fields have identical values. This checking for equality is required by Bloc.

Let's find how out `BluetoothDevice` is used to fetch `activeFirmwareVersion` and `standbyFirmwareVersion` from PineTime.

# Send Bluetooth LE Request to PineTime

Sending a Bluetooth LE command to PineTime is remarkably simple, straightforward, top to bottom... Thanks to Dart's support for [__Asynchronous Programming__](https://dart.dev/codelabs/async-await)!

Here are the steps...

1. __Connect to PineTime__ over Bluetooth LE

1. __Discover the GATT Services__ exposed by PineTime

1. __Find the right GATT Characteristic__ exposed by PineTime

1. __Transmit a Write Request__ to the GATT Characteristic

1. __Receive the response__ via a GATT Notification

1. __Decode the CBOR__ response

![Sending a Bluetooth LE command to PineTime](https://lupyuen.github.io/images/bloc-bluetooth.png)

## Connect to PineTime

Let's start by connecting to PineTime over Bluetooth LE: [`repositories/device_api_client.dart`](https://github.com/lupyuen/pinetime-companion/blob/bloc/lib/repositories/device_api_client.dart)

```dart
class DeviceApiClient {
  /// Connect to the PineTime device and query the firmare inside
  Future<Device> fetchDevice(BluetoothDevice bluetoothDevice) async {
    //  Connect to PineTime
    await bluetoothDevice.connect();
    ...
```

`DeviceApiClient` is the [__Data Repository__](https://bloclibrary.dev/#/architecture?id=repository) class that we expose to our Flutter App for sending Bluetooth LE commands to PineTime.

_(Yes the name `DeviceApiClient` is rather odd... It shall be renamed!)_

`fetchDevice()` is the method that sends the Bluetooth LE command to query PineTime's firmware images.

The method returns a `Device` Data Model that contains the Active and Standby Firmware version numbers.

`bluetoothDevice` is the Bluetooth interface returned by the [`flutter_blue` library for Bluetooth LE networking](https://github.com/pauldemarco/flutter_blue). (More about this later)

_Why do we use `await` when connecting to PineTime?_

```dart
  //  Connect to PineTime
  await bluetoothDevice.connect();
```

Connecting to PineTime over Bluetooth LE may take a while... And we should wait for it to complete before proceeding.

But we can't let the rest of the app freeze while waiting... What if the human taps the `Cancel` button!

`await` is exactly what we need. It waits for the `connect()` method to complete before proceeding to the next step... While keeping the user interface responsive!

That's the beauty of [__Asynchronous Programming__](https://dart.dev/codelabs/async-await) in Dart... No more Deeply Nested Callbacks and Promises! (Yep React Native gets really messy because of this)

_Why is the `fetchDevice()` method declared `async`?_

```dart
  /// Connect to the PineTime device and query the firmare inside
  Future<Device> fetchDevice(BluetoothDevice bluetoothDevice) async {
```

To use `await` we need two things...

1. Declare the method as `async` (like above)

1. Instead of returning a plain `Device` object, the method now returns a `Future<Device>` (like above)

Later we'll see that we may simply return a `Device` object as `Future<Device>`...

```dart
  //  Construct a Device object
  final device = Device( ... );
  //  Return it as Future<Device>
  return device;
```

Let's move on to discover GATT Services and Characteristics exposed by PineTime.

## Discover GATT Services

[In the previous article](https://lupyuen.github.io/pinetime-rust-mynewt/articles/companion) we learnt about the [__Simple Management Protocol__](https://github.com/apache/mynewt-mcumgr) that's exposed by PineTime for querying and updating firmware. We'll be sending the Query Firmware Command to PineTime through this protocol.

_(Simple Management Protocol is supported today on [__Mynewt__](https://github.com/apache/mynewt-mcumgr/blob/master/README-mynewt.md) and [__Zephyr__](https://github.com/apache/mynewt-mcumgr/blob/master/README-zephyr.md) open source embedded operating systems)_

The Simple Management Protocol is implemented over Bluetooth LE as a [GATT Service](https://learn.adafruit.com/introduction-to-bluetooth-low-energy/gatt). Thus to query the firmware on PineTime, we need to discover the GATT Services exposed by PineTime: [`repositories/device_api_client.dart`](https://github.com/lupyuen/pinetime-companion/blob/bloc/lib/repositories/device_api_client.dart)

```dart
//  Discover the services on PineTime
List<BluetoothService> services = await bluetoothDevice.discoverServices();
```

`discoverServices()` talks to PineTine over Bluetooth LE and returns a list of GATT Services exposed by PineTime.

We use `await` to discover GATT Services, so that the app won't freeze while waiting for the Bluetooth LE response.

The GATT Service for Simple Management Protocol has a UUID (unique ID) of `8D53DC1D-1DB7-4CD3-868B-8A527460AA84`...

```dart
//  Look for Simple Mgmt Protocol Service
for (BluetoothService service in services) {
  if (!listEquals(
    service.uuid.toByteArray(), 
    [0x8d,0x53,0xdc,0x1d,0x1d,0xb7,0x4c,0xd3,0x86,0x8b,0x8a,0x52,0x74,0x60,0xaa,0x84]
  )) { continue; }
```

That's how we hunt for the GATT Service.

## Find GATT Characteristic

Next we hunt for the GATT Characteristic (within the GATT Service) for Simple Management Protocol.

To transmit a command to PineTime, we shall write a request message ([in CBOR format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBOR)) to the GATT Characteristic.

Here's how we find the GATT Characteristic `DA2E7828-FBCE-4E01-AE9E-261174997C48` for the Simple Management Protocol: [`repositories/device_api_client.dart`](https://github.com/lupyuen/pinetime-companion/blob/bloc/lib/repositories/device_api_client.dart)

```dart
//  Look for Simple Mgmt Protocol Characteristic
var smpCharac;
var characteristics = service.characteristics;
for (BluetoothCharacteristic charac in characteristics) {
  if (!listEquals(
    charac.uuid.toByteArray(),
    [0xda,0x2e,0x78,0x28,0xfb,0xce,0x4e,0x01,0xae,0x9e,0x26,0x11,0x74,0x99,0x7c,0x48]
  )) { continue; }

  //  Found the characteristic
  smpCharac = charac;
  break;
}
```

If we can't find the GATT Service or the GATT Characteristic, we throw an exception...

```dart
//  If Simple Mgmt Protocol Service or Characteristic not found...
if (smpCharac == null) {
  bluetoothDevice.disconnect();
  throw new Exception('Device doesn\'t support Simple Management Protocol. You may need to flash a suitable firmware.');
}
```

## Write to GATT Characteristic

Now that we have the GATT Characteristic for the Simple Management Protocol, let's talk to the characteristic to send PineTime our Query Firmware Command.

First we compose a request message in CBOR (that includes an 8-byte header): [`repositories/device_api_client.dart`](https://github.com/lupyuen/pinetime-companion/blob/bloc/lib/repositories/device_api_client.dart)

```dart
//  Compose the Query Firmware request (Simple Mgmt Protocol)
final request = composeRequest();
```

`composeRequest()` has been documented [in our previous article](https://lupyuen.github.io/pinetime-rust-mynewt/articles/companion).  It sets `request` to a byte buffer that contains our request message for the Query Firmware Command...

```
00 00 00 01 00 01 3f 00 a0
```

_(8 bytes for the SMP Message Header, 1 byte for the CBOR Message Body, total 9 bytes)_

To transmit the request message to PineTime, we write to the GATT Characteristic for the Simple Management Protocol...

```dart
//  Transmit the Query Firmware request by writing to the SMP charactertistic
await smpCharac.write(request, withoutResponse: true);
```

Again we use `await` so that the app won't freeze while waiting for the writing to complete.

`withoutResponse` is set to `true` because we don't expect a synchronous response from the GATT Write operation... Instead we expect the response to be delivered via a GATT Notification. (More about this later)

Yay we have completed 67% of the work needed to send a Bluetooth LE command to PineTime!

Let's move on to receive the Bluetooth LE response from PineTime and decode the response.

![Handle Bluetooth LE Response from PineTime](https://lupyuen.github.io/images/bloc-bluetooth2.png)

# Handle Bluetooth LE Response from PineTime

Our story thus far...

1. We have connected to PineTime over Bluetooth LE

1. We have discovered the GATT Service for the Simple Management Protocol

1. We have located the GATT Characteristic for the Simple Management Protocol

1. We have transmitted our Query Firmware Request Message to PineTime... By writing the message to the GATT Characteristic

Now let's get the Query Firmware Response from PineTime in a special way...

_Will PineTime return the response immediately after writing to the GATT Characteristic?_

_Will PineTime let us read the response from the GATT Characteristic?_

Surprisingly, no and no! 

PineTime delivers the response via a __GATT Notification__. (Somewhat similar to Push Notifications on Android and iOS)

The response is __Asynchronous.__ Which is probably good for PineTime because it gives PineTime's Firmware more time to prepare and deliver the response. (Remember: PineTime isn't as powerful as a mobile phone)

First we subscribe to GATT Notifications like this: [`repositories/device_api_client.dart`](https://github.com/lupyuen/pinetime-companion/blob/bloc/lib/repositories/device_api_client.dart)

```dart
class DeviceApiClient {
  /// Connect to the PineTime device and query the firmare inside
  Future<Device> fetchDevice(BluetoothDevice bluetoothDevice) async {
    //  Omitted: Transmit the Query Firmware request by writing to the SMP charactertistic
    ...
    //  Subscribe to GATT Notifications from PineTime
    await smpCharac.setNotifyValue(true);
```

`setNotifyValue(true)` tells PineTime that we would like to receive GATT Notifications from our GATT Characteristic (the one from Simple Management Protocol).

```dart
    //  Create a completer to wait for response from PineTime
    final completer = Completer<typed.Uint8Buffer>();
    //  Create a byte buffer for the response
    final response = typed.Uint8Buffer();
```

Next we create a `Completer` and a byte buffer to hold the response.

_What's a `Completer`?_

It's something that we may `await` while waiting for our response to be received.

_(If you're familiar with JavaScript: A `Completer` is equivalent to a `Promise`)_

_Why can't we just `await` the response without a `Completer`?_

The Bluetooth LE API is somewhat quirky: To receive response bytes we need to use a __Callback Function__ like this...

```dart
    //  Receive response bytes, chunk by chunk
    smpCharac.value.listen((value) {
      //  Add the chunk to our response buffer
      response.addAll(value);

      //  Get the expected message length
      if (response.length < 4) { return; }           //  Length field not available
      final len = (response[2] << 8) + response[3];  //  Length field in bytes 2 and 3
      final responseLength = len + 8;  //  Response includes 8 bytes for header

      //  If the received response length is already the expected response length, mark response as complete
      if (response.length >= responseLength && !completer.isCompleted) {
        completer.complete(response);
      }
    });
```

The code in the above Callback Function will be called every time our Flutter App receives a chunk of GATT Notification bytes (`value`) from PineTime.  We append each chunk to our response buffer.

When we have received the final chunk of response bytes, we call `Completer.complete()` like this...

```dart
    completer.complete(response);
```

This signals to `await` that the response is complete...

```dart
    //  Wait for the completer to finish receiving the entire response
    final response2 = await completer.future;
```

And that's how `await` and `Completer` work together to simplify Callback Functions!

_(If you're familiar with JavaScript: `Completer.complete()` is equivalent to `Promise.resolve()`)_

_How will we know when we have received the final chunk of response bytes?_

Earlier we saw this code for handling the response bytes...

```dart
    //  Get the expected message length
    if (response.length < 4) { return; }           //  Length field not available
    final len = (response[2] << 8) + response[3];  //  Length field in bytes 2 and 3
    final responseLength = len + 8;  //  Response includes 8 bytes for header
```

The response message length is stored in bytes 2 and 3 of the response message.

That's how we know when there are no more bytes to be received, and trigger `Completer.complete()`.

![Decode CBOR Response from PineTime](https://lupyuen.github.io/images/bloc-bluetooth3.png)

# Decode CBOR Response from PineTime

Finally we come to the last piece of the puzzle... How `BluetoothDevice` is used to fetch `activeFirmwareVersion` and `standbyFirmwareVersion` from PineTime.

Earlier we have obtained a byte buffer `response2` that contains the response bytes: 
[`repositories/device_api_client.dart`](https://github.com/lupyuen/pinetime-companion/blob/bloc/lib/repositories/device_api_client.dart)

```dart
class DeviceApiClient {
  /// Connect to the PineTime device and query the firmare inside
  Future<Device> fetchDevice(BluetoothDevice bluetoothDevice) async {
    //  Omitted: Transmit request to PineTime over Bluetooth LE
    ...
    //  Wait for the completer to finish receiving the entire response
    final response2 = await completer.future;
```

Before decoding `response2`, let's disconnect the Bluetooth LE connection to PineTime (and conserve battery power)...

```dart
    //  Disconnect the PineTime device
    bluetoothDevice.disconnect();
```

_What's inside `response2`?_

`response2` contains...

- __Response Message Header:__ 8 bytes, followed by...

- __Response Message Body:__ 244 bytes, encoded in [CBOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBOR)

It looks like this...

_What's in the Response Message Header?_

Let's decode the first 8 bytes above according to the Simple Management Protocol message header definition in [`mynewt-mcumgr/mgmt.h`](https://github.com/apache/mynewt-mcumgr/blob/master/mgmt/include/mgmt/mgmt.h)...

| Header Field | Value | Description
| :--- | :--- | :--- 
| `Op`    | `01`    | [Operation Code](https://github.com/apache/mynewt-mcumgr/blob/master/mgmt/include/mgmt/mgmt.h#L33-L37) (1 for Read Response)
| `Flags` | `00`    | Unused
| `Len`   | `00 f4` | Length of Message Body (244 bytes)
| `Group` | `00 01` | [Group ID](https://github.com/apache/mynewt-mcumgr/blob/master/mgmt/include/mgmt/mgmt.h#L39-L53) (1 for Image Management)
| `Seq`   | `3f` | Message Sequence Number (should match the request message)
| `Id`    | `00` | Message ID (0 for Image Listing)

Yep, this confirms that we have received a response to our Query Firmware (Image Listing) Command.

_What's all the mumbo jumbo in the Response Message Body?_

The Response Message Body is encoded in [CBOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBOR), a compact binary form of JSON.

We decode the message body like this...

```dart
    //  Extract the CBOR message body
    final body = typed.Uint8Buffer();
    body.addAll(response2.sublist(8));  //  Remove the 8-byte header

    //  Decode the CBOR message body
    final decodedBody = decodeCBOR(body);
```

`decodeCBOR()` calls the [CBOR Library](https://pub.dev/packages/cbor) to decode the CBOR data into JSON...

```dart
/// Decode the CBOR message body
List<dynamic> decodeCBOR(typed.Uint8Buffer payload) {
  //  Get our CBOR instance. Always do this, it correctly initialises the decoder.
  final inst = cbor.Cbor();

  //  Decode from the buffer
  inst.decodeFromBuffer(payload);
  return inst.getDecodedData();
}
```

The decoded JSON in `decodedBody` looks like this...

```json
{
    "images": [
        {
            "slot": 0,
            "version": "1.0.0",
            "hash": [
                234,188,58,206,116,168,40,76,111,120,194,188,173,58,225,141,57,38,117,199,102,197,31,149,35,15,19,57,63,8,28,93
            ],
            "bootable": true,
            "pending": false,
            "confirmed": true,
            "active": true,
            "permanent": false
        },
        {
            "slot": 1,
            "version": "1.1.0",
            "hash": [
                13,120,73,247,254,67,146,122,135,215,180,213,84,248,67,8,130,51,216,2,213,9,12,32,218,161,230,167,119,114,153,110
            ],
            "bootable": true,
            "pending": false,
            "confirmed": false,
            "active": false,
            "permanent": false
        }
    ],
    "splitStatus": 0
}
```

_Is PineTime telling us what it's hiding?_

Yes, our PineTime is keeping two firmware images...

1. __Active Firmware:__ Version 1.0.0 (Slot 0, in Internal Flash ROM)

1. __Standby Firmware:__ Version 1.1.0 (Slot 1, in External SPI Flash)

Remember that PineTime always boots from the Active Firmware Image. The Standby Firmware Image is used when updating or rolling back the firmware.

The hash values of the firmware images will be used later when we update the PineTime firmware.

_How shall we extract the Active and Standby Firmware Versions from the JSON?_

By accessing the Dynamic List like this...

```dart
    //  Get the list of firmware images
    final images = decodedBody[0]['images'] as List<dynamic>;

    //  Construct the Device Data Model with the firmware versions
    final device = Device(
      bluetoothDevice:        bluetoothDevice,
      activeFirmwareVersion:  (images.length >= 1) ? images[0]['version'] : '',
      standbyFirmwareVersion: (images.length >= 2) ? images[1]['version'] : '',
    );

    //  Return the Device Data Model
    return device;
```

And that's how we fetch the the Active and Standby Firmware Versions to construct the `Device` Data Model!

_Besides fetching the firmware versions, what can else we do with Bluetooth LE commands?_

Plenty! We may update PineTime's firmware over Bluetooth LE, sync the date and time, push mobile notifications, capture our heart rate and even control smart home gadgets!

PineTime firmware exposes the [Simple Management Protocol](https://github.com/apache/mynewt-mcumgr) over Bluetooth LE. The protocol supports a [rich set of commands](https://github.com/apache/mynewt-mcumgr/tree/master/cmd) for updating PineTime firmware, accessing the PineTime Flash filesystem, debug logs, runtime statistics, ...

We shall be adding these commands to the PineTime Companion App.

# Business Logic, States and Events in Bloc

Now back to State Management with Bloc... The right way to manage our complex Flutter App is to use a __Business Logic Class (Bloc),__ to drive the __Event Transitions__ between the __States__ of the app...

![Business Logic driving Event Transitions between the States of the app](https://lupyuen.github.io/images/bloc-transitions1.png)

A shown above, our __Device Bloc__ contains the Business Logic that manages three __Device States__ (ovals) and two __Device Events__ (arrows).

Each Device State corresponds to a screen in our Flutter App...

1. __`DeviceInitial`:__ Initial screen of our app

1. __`DeviceLoadInProgress`:__ PineTime selection screen

1. __`DeviceLoadSuccess`:__ PineTime summary screen

In Bloc, a Flutter App changes its State (i.e. moves from one screen to the next), when an Event is triggered (like `DeviceRequested`)

## Business Logic

_How shall we code the States and Event Transitions in Bloc?_

With a Bloc Class like so: [`blocs/device_bloc.dart`](https://github.com/lupyuen/pinetime-companion/blob/bloc/lib/blocs/device_bloc.dart)

```dart
/// Device Bloc that manages the Device States and Device Events
class DeviceBloc extends Bloc<DeviceEvent, DeviceState> {
  /// Data Repository that will be used to fetch data from PineTime
  final DeviceRepository deviceRepository;

  /// Construct a Device Bloc. Data Repository is mandatory.
  DeviceBloc({@required this.deviceRepository})
      : assert(deviceRepository != null);

  /// Return the initial Device State (which corresponds to the initial screen)
  @override
  DeviceState get initialState => DeviceInitial();

  /// When a Device Event is triggered, move to a new Device State (and a new screen)
  @override
  Stream<DeviceState> mapEventToState(DeviceEvent event) async* {
    if (event is DeviceRequested) {
      //  Handle the DeviceRequested Event by loading data from PineTime
      yield* _mapDeviceRequestedToState(event);
    } else if (event is DeviceRefreshRequested) {
      //  Handle the Refresh button by updating the Device Widget
      yield* _mapDeviceRefreshRequestedToState(event);
    }
  }

  /// Handle the DeviceRequested Event by loading data from PineTime
  Stream<DeviceState> _mapDeviceRequestedToState(
    DeviceRequested event,
  ) async* {
    //  Notify the Device Widget that we are loading data
    yield DeviceLoadInProgress();
    try {
      //  Load data from PineTime over Bluetooth LE
      final Device device = await deviceRepository.getDevice(event.device);
      //  Move to the DeviceLoadSuccess State, which renders the Device Summary Widget
      yield DeviceLoadSuccess(device: device);
    } catch (_) {
      //  In case of error, move to the DeviceLoadFailure State
      yield DeviceLoadFailure();
    }
  }
```

`DeviceBloc` contains the Business Logic that interprets the triggered Events and drives the States in our app.  Let's inspect the code in `DeviceBloc`.

## Trigger Events

_How are Events defined in Bloc?_

We define the `DeviceRequested` Event like so: [`blocs/device_bloc.dart`](https://github.com/lupyuen/pinetime-companion/blob/bloc/lib/blocs/device_bloc.dart)

```dart
/// Device Requested Event that will shift the Device States
class DeviceRequested extends DeviceEvent {
  /// Bluetooth API for connecting to PineTime, from flutter_blue library
  final BluetoothDevice device;

  /// Construct a Device Requested Event. Bluetooth Device is mandatory.
  const DeviceRequested({@required this.device}) : 
    assert(device != null);

  /// Return the properties of the Device Requested Event
  @override
  List<Object> get props => [
    device
  ];
}
```

_How are Events triggered in Bloc?_

Let's look at the first `DeviceRequested` Event. It moves the app from `DeviceInitial` State to `DeviceLoadInProgress` State...

![DeviceRequested Event triggered upon pressing the Search Button](https://lupyuen.github.io/images/bloc-transitions2.png)

The `DeviceRequested` Event is triggered when the human presses the __Search Button__ üîç (At top right of the screen)

Here's the code for the Search Button that triggers the `DeviceRequested` Event: [`widgets/device.dart`](https://github.com/lupyuen/pinetime-companion/blob/bloc/lib/widgets/device.dart)

```dart
/// Implement the Stateful Widget for the PineTime Companion screen
class _DeviceState extends State<Device> {
  /// Render the PineTime Companion screen
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    //  Render the screen with Button Bar above, followed by the Body
    return Scaffold(
      //  Button Bar for the screen
      appBar: AppBar(
        //  Buttons for the Button Bar
        actions: <Widget>[
          ...
          //  Search Button
          IconButton(
            ...
            //  When the Search Button is pressed...
            onPressed: () async {
              //  Navigate to a new screen...
              final device = await Navigator.push(
                context,
                MaterialPageRoute(
                  //  For browsing Bluetooth LE devices
                  builder: (context) => FindDevice(),
                ),
              );

              //  When the Bluetooth LE browser returns the PineTime Bluetooth Device...
              if (device != null) {
                //  Get the Bloc that handles Device Events...
                BlocProvider
                  .of<DeviceBloc>(context)
                  //  Trigger the DeviceRequested Event...
                  .add(
                    //  With the PineTime Bluetooth Device inside
                    DeviceRequested(
                      device: device
                    )
                  );
              }
```

`FindDevice()` shows the widget for browsing Bluetooth LE devices. `FindDevice()` is defined here: [`widgets/find_device.dart`](https://github.com/lupyuen/pinetime-companion/blob/bloc/lib/widgets/find_device.dart)

_What does `FindDevice()` return?_

It returns the `flutter_blue` Bluetooth Device (i.e. PineTime) that was selected by the human.

The Bluetooth Device shall be used in the next step for reading the firmware versions from PineTime.

## Load Data

Loading data over the web or Bluetooth shouldn't cause our Flutter App to freeze. Bloc has a clever solution: We trigger an Event asynchronously to load data, so that our app remains responsive!

Earlier we have triggered the `DeviceRequested` Event upon pressing the Search Button: [`widgets/device.dart`](https://github.com/lupyuen/pinetime-companion/blob/bloc/lib/widgets/device.dart)

```dart
//  When Search Button has been pressed and Bluetooth Device has been selected...
//  Get the Bloc that handles Device Events...
BlocProvider
  .of<DeviceBloc>(context)
  //  Trigger the DeviceRequested Event...
  .add(
    //  With the PineTime Bluetooth Device inside
    DeviceRequested(
      device: device
    )
  );
```

We handle the `DeviceRequested` Event in our Device Bloc (Business Logic) like so...

![DeviceRequested Event triggered after loading data from PineTime](https://lupyuen.github.io/images/bloc-transitions3.png)

Here's how we code this in `DeviceBloc`: [`blocs/device_bloc.dart`](https://github.com/lupyuen/pinetime-companion/blob/bloc/lib/blocs/device_bloc.dart)

```dart
/// Device Bloc that manages the Device States and Device Events
class DeviceBloc extends Bloc<DeviceEvent, DeviceState> {
  ...
  /// When a Device Event is triggered, move to a new Device State (and a new screen)
  @override
  Stream<DeviceState> mapEventToState(DeviceEvent event) async* {
    if (event is DeviceRequested) {
      //  Handle the DeviceRequested Event by loading data from PineTime
      yield* _mapDeviceRequestedToState(event);
      ...
```

`mapEventToState()` delegates the handling of the `DeviceRequested` Event to the function `_mapDeviceRequestedToState()`, which we'll see in a while.

_Why is `mapEventToState()` marked as `async*` instead of `async`?_

`mapEventToState()` responds to an Event by returning one State... Or a delayed sequence of States (which we'll see in `_mapDeviceRequestedToState()`).

To return a delayed sequence of States, we declare the method as `async*`.

Also note that instead of returning `Future<DeviceState>` (a single delayed Device State), we now return `Stream<DeviceState>` (a delayed sequence of Device States).

And instead of using `yield`, we use `yield*` to return a delayed sequence of States.

_Why does `_mapDeviceRequestedToState()` return a delayed sequence of States, instead of a single State?_

Because it returns two States: `DeviceLoadInProgress` first, followed by `DeviceLoadSuccess` a short while later.

`_mapDeviceRequestedToState()` responds to the `DeviceRequested` Event by first returning the `DeviceLoadInProgress` State: [`blocs/device_bloc.dart`](https://github.com/lupyuen/pinetime-companion/blob/bloc/lib/blocs/device_bloc.dart)

```dart
/// Handle the DeviceRequested Event by loading data from PineTime
Stream<DeviceState> _mapDeviceRequestedToState(
  DeviceRequested event,
) async* {
  //  Notify the Device Widget that we are loading data
  yield DeviceLoadInProgress();
  ...
```

When the Device Widget sees the `DeviceLoadInProgress` State, it renders a Loading Animation to keep the human entertained: [`widgets/device.dart`](https://github.com/lupyuen/pinetime-companion/blob/bloc/lib/widgets/device.dart)

```dart
  //  If Device is loading, show the Loading Animation
  builder: (context, state) {
    if (state is DeviceLoadInProgress) {
      return Center(child: CircularProgressIndicator());
    }
```

Next `_mapDeviceRequestedToState()` performs the actual loading of data: [`blocs/device_bloc.dart`](https://github.com/lupyuen/pinetime-companion/blob/bloc/lib/blocs/device_bloc.dart)

```dart
  //  After notifying the Device Widget that we are loading data...
  //  Load data from PineTime over Bluetooth LE
  final Device device = await deviceRepository.getDevice(event.device);
```

It calls the Device Repository to fetch the firmware versions from PineTime over Bluetooth LE.

`getDevice()` (defined in [`repositories/device_repository.dart`](https://github.com/lupyuen/pinetime-companion/blob/bloc/lib/repositories/device_repository.dart)) calls `fetchDevice()`.

We have previously seen `fetchDevice()` in [`repositories/device_api_client.dart`](https://github.com/lupyuen/pinetime-companion/blob/bloc/lib/repositories/device_api_client.dart)... It talks to PineTime over Bluetooth LE to fetch the firmware versions.

Finally `_mapDeviceRequestedToState()` returns the `DeviceLoadSuccess` State...

```dart
  //  Move to the DeviceLoadSuccess State, which renders the Device Summary Widget
  yield DeviceLoadSuccess(device: device);
```

The `DeviceLoadSuccess` State contains a `Device` Data Model that has the firmware versions inside.

Asynchronous data loading accomplished!

## Update Widgets

_How are Widgets updated in Bloc?_

In Bloc, widgets listen for State updates and redraw themselves.

In the previous section we have loaded the `Device` Data Model from PineTime and updated the State to `DeviceLoadSuccess`. Now let's listen for State updates and re-render the Device Widget...

![Updating of Widgets](https://lupyuen.github.io/images/bloc-transitions4.png)

The Device Widget listens for the `DeviceLoadSuccess` State with a [__`BlocConsumer`__](https://bloclibrary.dev/#/flutterbloccoreconcepts?id=blocconsumer) and rebuilds itself like so: [`widgets/device.dart`](https://github.com/lupyuen/pinetime-companion/blob/bloc/lib/widgets/device.dart)

```dart
/// Implement the Stateful Widget for the PineTime Companion screen
class _DeviceState extends State<Device> {
  /// Render the PineTime Companion screen
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    //  Render the screen with Button Bar above, followed by the Body
    return Scaffold(
      //  Button Bar for the screen (omitted)
      appBar: ...,

      //  Body for the screen
      body: 
        ...
        //  Construct a BlocConsumer to listen for updates to the state and rebuild the widget
        BlocConsumer<DeviceBloc, DeviceState>(
          //  Listen for updates to the state (omitted)
          listener: ...

          //  Rebuild the widget when the state is updated
          builder: (context, state) {
            //  When we have loaded the device info...
            if (state is DeviceLoadSuccess) {
              //  Get the device info from the new state
              final device = state.device;

              //  Construct the Device Summary with the device info
              return 
                ...
                DeviceSummary(
                  device: device,
                ),
                ...
```

## Multiple Blocs

_Can we use multiple Blocs?_

Yes we can! There are two Blocs in our Flutter App...

1. `DeviceBloc`: For loading data in our app

1. `ThemeBloc`: For updating the UI theme in our app

The Device Widget uses a Theme Bloc nested inside a Device Bloc like this: [`widgets/device.dart`](https://github.com/lupyuen/pinetime-companion/blob/bloc/lib/widgets/device.dart)

```dart
/// Implement the Stateful Widget for the PineTime Companion screen
class _DeviceState extends State<Device> {
  /// Render the PineTime Companion screen
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    //  Render the screen with Button Bar above, followed by the Body
    return Scaffold(
      //  Button Bar for the screen (omitted)
      appBar: ...,

      //  Body for the screen
      body: 
        ...
        //  Construct a Device BlocConsumer to listen for updates to the Device State and rebuild the widget
        BlocConsumer<DeviceBloc, DeviceState>(
          //  Listen for updates to the Device State
          listener: (context, state) {
            //  If the device has been loaded successfully...
            if (state is DeviceLoadSuccess) {
              //  Get the Theme Bloc that handles Theme States...
              BlocProvider
                .of<ThemeBloc>(context)
                //  Trigger a DeviceChanged Event to the Theme Bloc
                .add(
                  DeviceChanged(
                    condition: state.device.condition
                  ),
                  ...
```

In the code above, the `DeviceLoadSuccess` State triggers a `DeviceChanged` Theme Event (defined in [`blocs/theme_bloc.dart`](https://github.com/lupyuen/pinetime-companion/blob/bloc/lib/blocs/theme_bloc.dart)).

We handle the `DeviceChanged` Theme Event in the Theme Bloc like so: [`blocs/theme_bloc.dart`](https://github.com/lupyuen/pinetime-companion/blob/bloc/lib/blocs/theme_bloc.dart)

```dart
/// Theme Bloc that manages the Theme States and Theme Events
class ThemeBloc extends Bloc<ThemeEvent, ThemeState> {
  /// When a Theme Event is triggered, move to a new Theme State
  @override
  Stream<ThemeState> mapEventToState(ThemeEvent event) async* {
    if (event is DeviceChanged) {
      yield _mapDeviceConditionToTheme(event.condition);
    }
  }

  /// Return the UI Theme based on the current condition
  ThemeState _mapDeviceConditionToTheme(DeviceCondition condition) {
    ThemeState theme;
      //  Return the UI Theme with indigo colours
    theme = ThemeState(
      theme: ThemeData(
        primaryColor: Colors.indigoAccent,
      ),
      color: Colors.indigo,
    );
    return theme;
  }
```

## Tracing States and Events

_How do we verify that States and Events are working correctly in Bloc?_

In VSCode, look at the __Debug Console__.

It shows the Events triggered and the transitions between States...

```
(...Search button pressed...)

onEvent DeviceRequested
Fetching device...
onTransition Transition { 
  currentState: DeviceInitial, 
  event: DeviceRequested, 
  nextState: DeviceLoadInProgress 
}

(...Transmit Bluetooth LE Request to PineTime...)
(...Receive Bluetooth LE Response from PineTime...)

onTransition Transition { 
  currentState: DeviceLoadInProgress, 
  event: DeviceRequested, 
  nextState: DeviceLoadSuccess 
}
onEvent DeviceChanged

(...Render DeviceSummary widget...)

_PineTime Companion App on iPhone_

# What's Next

The code in this article is part of the upcoming open source [__PineTime Companion App__](https://github.com/lupyuen/pinetime-companion) for Android and iOS. So that we can update the firmware on our PineTime Smart Watches wirelessly, sync the date and time, show notifications from our phone, chart our heart rate, ... Maybe even control our smart home gadgets! 

We'll be doing lots more coding...

1. __Handle Other PineTime Commands:__ Update firmware, sync date and time, show mobile notifications, control smart home gadgets (via IFTTT and MQTT), ...

    We shall do this by taking the [Newt Manager](https://github.com/apache/mynewt-newtmgr) code in Go and converting it to Flutter and Dart, as explained here...

    _["Convert Go to Flutter and Dart for PineTime Companion App"](https://lupyuen.github.io/pinetime-rust-mynewt/articles/companion)_

1. __Companion App for Linux Phones (like PinePhone):__ We shall take the [Newt Manager](https://github.com/apache/mynewt-newtmgr) code in Go and wrap it into a GTK3 app, using the [`gotk3` library](https://github.com/gotk3/gotk3)...

    _["Your First GTK App with Go and VSCodium"](https://lupyuen.github.io/pinetime-rust-mynewt/articles/gotk3)_

1. __PineTime Firmware Support:__ Today our PineTime Companion App talks to Mynewt and Zephyr operating systems on PineTime. We hope to implement the same Bluetooth LE protocol (Simple Management Protocol) on other operating systems, so that they may also enjoy wireless firmware updates...

    _["Firmware Update over Bluetooth Low Energy on PineTime Smart Watch"](https://lupyuen.github.io/pinetime-rust-mynewt/articles/dfu)_

_Why are we maintaining two code bases: Flutter (for Android and iOS) and Go (for Linux phones)?_

Because Flutter is probably the best way to build mobile apps... But it's not officially supported for Linux phones.  The `flutter_blue` plugin doesn't support Linux either.  

So we need to stick with Go for Linux phones.

We're now exploring [__`go-flutter`__](https://github.com/go-flutter-desktop/go-flutter) for porting the Flutter App to Linux. And recode `flutter_blue` via FFI to a Linux Bluetooth LE library (in Go or C).

_(Maybe someday when Flutter is officially supported on Linux phones, we can scrap the Go version!)_

If you're keen to help out with the PineTime Companion App (or anything else in PineTime), __come chat with the PineTime FOSS Community (and me) in the PineTime Chatroom!__
