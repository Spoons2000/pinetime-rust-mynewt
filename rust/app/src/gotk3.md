_GTK+3 Go App with VSCodium and Manjaro Xfce on Pinebook Pro_

üìù _18 Jun 2020_

Creating desktop apps on Linux doesn't have to be hard... Let's build __[GTK+3](https://www.gtk.org/) apps in [Go](https://golang.org/)__ with the __[`gotk3`](https://github.com/gotk3/gotk3)__ library!

Read on to find out how we install the GTK+3 Go tools to build desktop apps on __Manjaro, Arch Linux, Ubuntu and Debian__.  

The steps have been tested on...

1. __Pinebook Pro__ with __Manjaro Xfce__ (other flavours should work fine)

1. __Pinebook Pro__ with __Debian Mate__ (consider installing Manjaro Xfce for much better performance)

1. __Raspberry Pi 4__ with __Manjaro Xfce__ 64-bit (other flavours should work fine)

1. __Raspberry Pi 4__ with __Ubuntu Desktop__ 20.04 64-bit

They will probably work on Intel x64 distros of Linux too.

(Sorry, Raspberry Pi with Raspbian refuses to install the GTK tools... So please use Manjaro or Ubuntu)

# Coding GTK with Go

We'll be creating this simple desktop GUI app...

![GTK3 Go App](https://lupyuen.github.io/images/gotk3-app.png)

With this Go code that calls the `gotk3` library...

```go
func newStackFull() gtk.IWidget {
	// get a stack and its switcher.
	stack, err := gtk.StackNew()
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal("Unable to get text:", err)
	}

	sw, err := gtk.StackSwitcherNew()
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal("Unable to get text:", err)
	}
	sw.SetStack(stack)

	// Fill the stack with 3 pages.
	boxText1 := newBoxText("Hello there!")
	boxRadio := newBoxRadio("choice 1", "choice 2", "choice 3", "choice 4")
	boxText2 := newBoxText("third page")

	stack.AddTitled(boxText1, "key1", "first page")
	stack.AddTitled(boxRadio, "key2", "second page")
	stack.AddTitled(boxText2, "key3", "third page")

	// You can use icons for a switcher page (the page title will be visible as tooltip).
	stack.ChildSetProperty(boxRadio, "icon-name", "list-add")

	// Pack in a box.
	box := setup_box(gtk.ORIENTATION_VERTICAL)
	box.PackStart(sw, false, false, 0)
	box.PackStart(stack, true, true, 0)
	return box
}
```

See the rest of the code here: [`gtk-examples/stack/stack.go`](https://github.com/gotk3/gotk3-examples/blob/master/gtk-examples/stack/stack.go)

_Why use Go to code GTK apps?_

1. Go looks so __neat and tidy__ for writing GUI apps with GTK!

1. Go compiles to __machine code__ so it's fast ([More details](https://benhoyt.com/writings/go-intro/))

1. Go supports __Garbage Collection__, so no worries about scary C pointers

_In the code above, why are type names omitted when we declare variables?_

Because Go is __Static Typed__ and it inferences the types of variables based on their usage.

No more runtime type errors! (The ones we see in JavaScript)

# Install Build Tools

__1Ô∏è‚É£ For Manjaro and Arch Linux...__

At the command prompt enter...

```bash
sudo pacman -S gtk3 cairo glib2 go
```

Proceed to the next section _"Install VSCodium"_

__2Ô∏è‚É£ For Ubuntu and Debian...__

At the command prompt enter...

```bash
sudo apt install libgtk-3-dev libcairo2-dev libglib2.0-dev
```

Follow the instructions here to install the Go build tools:

[`golang.org/doc/install`](https://golang.org/doc/install)

# Install VSCodium

We'll be installing [__VSCodium__](https://github.com/VSCodium/vscodium), the community build of VSCode that doesn't have Microsoft branding and telemetry. VSCodium has better support for Arm Linux than VSCode.

Note that VSCodium uses its own Extensions Marketplace, so that it doesn't violate Microsoft's terms of use. VSCodium Marketplace Extensions may be slightly different from the VSCode Marketplace.

__1Ô∏è‚É£ For Manjaro and Arch Linux...__

Enable __Arch User Repository (AUR)__ in the Arch Package Manager `pamac-manager`... 

[_"How to Use AUR on Arch and Manjaro Linux?"_](https://itsfoss.com/aur-arch-linux/)

In the Package Manager, search for `vscodium-bin` and install it.

__2Ô∏è‚É£ For Ubuntu and Debian...__

Follow the instructions here to install VSCodium:

[`github.com/VSCodium/vscodium`](https://github.com/VSCodium/vscodium)

# Download Source Code For Our App

Let's download the `gotk3` sample code...

1. Launch VSCodium, click `View ‚Üí Command Palette`

1. Enter `Git Clone`

1. Enter `https://github.com/gotk3/gotk3-examples`

1. Select a folder to download the source code

1. When prompted to open the cloned repository, click `Open`

1. In the `Explorer ‚Üí Workspace` pane at left, browse to `gtk-examples ‚Üí stack`

1. Double-click on `stack.go`. This is the Go app that we shall be building...

![Source code of our GTK3 Go app in VSCodium](https://lupyuen.github.io/images/gotk3-source.png)

# Build And Run Our App

1. In VSCodium, click `Terminal ‚Üí New Terminal`

1. At the Terminal prompt, enter...

    ```bash
    cd gtk-examples/stack
    go get github.com/gotk3/gotk3/gtk
    go build stack.go
    ls -l
    ```

    The `go get` command may take 10 minutes or longer to build the `gotk3` library... Be patient! This only needs to be done once.

    The `ls -l` command should show the compiled Go executable named `stack`...

    ![Our compiled GTK3 Go App](https://lupyuen.github.io/images/gotk3-build.png)

1. At the Terminal prompt, enter...

    ```bash
    ./stack
    ```

    This launches our newly-built GTK+3 Go app...

And that's how we build GTK apps with Go!

# What's Next

Check the [`gotk3` documentation](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/gotk3/gotk3/gtk?tab=doc) to explore all the GTK widgets available in Go: List Box, Notebook, File Chooser Dialog, ...

If the Go code looks cumbersome, there's another option for coding GTK apps in Go: [__Glade UI Builder for GTK__](https://glade.gnome.org/)

The output from Glade may be integrated into a Go app with `gotk3` like this: [`gotk3-glade-example`](https://github.com/mrccnt/gotk3-glade-example)

The code in this article is part of the upcoming open source __PineTime Companion App__ for Linux phones (like PinePhone). So that we can flash our PineTime Smart Watches wirelessly, sync the date and time, show notifications from our phone, chart our heart rate, ... Maybe even control our smart home gadgets! 

If you're keen to help out, come chat with the PineTime FOSS Community (and me) in the PineTime Chatroom!
