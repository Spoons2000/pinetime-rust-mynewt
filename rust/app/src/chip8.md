# Start the CHIP-8¬†Emulator

We're using the [libchip8 CHIP-8 Emulator for Rust](https://github.com/YushiOMOTE/libchip8). To start the emulator, we load the ROM file for the CHIP-8 game into memory, and call the Emulator to start the game...

```rust
///  Run the emulator
extern "C" fn task_func(_arg: Ptr) {    
    //  Create the hardware API for rendering the emulator
    let hardware = Hardware::new();

    //  Create the emulator
    let chip8 = libchip8::Chip8::new(hardware);

    //  Load the emulator ROM
    let rom = include_bytes!("../roms/blinky.ch8");

    //  Run the emulator ROM. This will block until emulator terminates
    chip8.run(rom);

    //  Should not come here
    assert!(false, "CHIP8 should not end");
}
```
_From https://github.com/lupyuen/pinetime-rust-mynewt/blob/master/rust/app/src/chip8.rs#L78-L98_

Note the neat syntax used in Rust to load binary files into memory...

```rust
    //  Load the emulator ROM
    let rom = include_bytes!("../roms/blinky.ch8");
```

`blinky.ch8` is a binary file that contains the program and data for the Blinky CHIP-8 game. By calling the `include_bytes!` macro, we load the entire binary file into memory as a Rust static memory object.

[Here's a list of available CHIP-8 ROM files](https://github.com/dmatlack/chip8/tree/master/roms) that we may download into the [`rust/app/roms` folder](https://github.com/lupyuen/pinetime-rust-mynewt/tree/master/rust/app/roms)

How is `Hardware` used? We'll find out next...

# Set a Pixel¬†Colour

`libchip8` is a clever CHIP-8 Emulator that supports all kinds of platforms, including Windows. _How does it do that?_

`libchip8` abstracts all platform-specific operations (like Screen Updates) into the `Hardware` trait.  Here's how we implement the `Hardware` trait on PineTime to set a screen pixel on or off...

```rust
impl libchip8::Hardware for Hardware {
    /// Set the color of a pixel in the screen. true for white, and false for black.
    fn vram_set(&mut self, x: usize, y: usize, color: bool) {
        assert!(x < SCREEN_WIDTH,  "x overflow");  //  x must be 0 to 63
        assert!(y < SCREEN_HEIGHT, "y overflow");  //  y must be 0 to 31
        let i = x + y * SCREEN_WIDTH;              //  index into screen buffer
        unsafe { SCREEN_BUFFER[i] =  //  Screen the screen buffer to...
            if color { 255 }         //  White pixel
            else     {   0 }         //  Black pixel
        };
        //  Remember the boundary of the screen region to be updated
        if self.update_left == 0 && self.update_right == 0 &&
            self.update_top == 0 && self.update_bottom == 0 {
            self.update_left = x as u8; self.update_right  = x as u8;
            self.update_top  = y as u8; self.update_bottom = y as u8;
        }
        //  If this pixel is outside the the boundary of the screen region to be updated, extend the boundary
        if (x as u8) < self.update_left   { self.update_left = x as u8;   }
        if (x as u8) > self.update_right  { self.update_right = x as u8;  }
        if (y as u8) < self.update_top    { self.update_top = y as u8;    }
        if (y as u8) > self.update_bottom { self.update_bottom = y as u8; }
    }
```
_From https://github.com/lupyuen/pinetime-rust-mynewt/blob/master/rust/app/src/chip8.rs#L169-L198_

_(`u8` means unsigned byte; `usize` is similar to `size_t` in C )_

The CHIP-8 Emulator has a simple screen layout: 64 rows, 32 columns, 1-bit colour (black or white). `vram_set` updates the pixel colour in a greyscale memory buffer named `SCREEN_BUFFER` that's only 2 KB (64 rows of 32 bytes)...

```rust
/// CHIP8 Virtual Screen size, in Virtual Pixels
const SCREEN_WIDTH:  usize = 64;
const SCREEN_HEIGHT: usize = 32;
/// CHIP8 Virtual Screen Buffer, 8-bit greyscale (from black=0 to white=255) per Virtual Pixel.
/// The greyscale is mapped to 16-bit colour for display.
static mut SCREEN_BUFFER: [u8; SCREEN_WIDTH * SCREEN_HEIGHT] = [0; SCREEN_WIDTH * SCREEN_HEIGHT];  //  2 KB (64 rows of 32 bytes), u8 means unsigned byte
```
_From https://github.com/lupyuen/pinetime-rust-mynewt/blob/master/rust/app/src/chip8.rs#L19-L37_

_Why did we allocate 8 bits per pixel in `SCREEN_BUFFER`?_ 

So that we can implement interesting colour effects. (We'll cover this later) We actually update `SCREEN_BUFFER` with a greyscale colour like this...

```rust
//  color is true when emulator draws a white pixel, black otherwise
unsafe { SCREEN_BUFFER[i] = 
    if color {
        if self.is_interactive { 255 }  //  Brighter colour when emulator is active
        else { 200 }                    //  Darker colour for initial screen
    } 
    else { 
        if self.is_interactive { 127 }  //  Fade to black
        else { 0 }                      //  Black for initial screen                 
    }  
};
```
_From https://github.com/lupyuen/pinetime-rust-mynewt/blob/master/rust/app/src/chip8.rs#L169-L198_

_Something seems to be missing... `vram_set` updates a screen buffer in memory... But we haven't actually updated the PineTime display!_

`vram_set` is called every time the Emulator paints a pixel. Instead of refreshing the PineTime display pixel by pixel, we update the display by __Sprite__ instead. 

_What's a Sprite?_

No not the lemon-lime drink... It's the graphic that moves around in a game. In the Blinky / Pac-Man game, Pac-Man and the Ghosts are rendered as Sprites.

_How do we know when a Sprite has been drawn?_ 

We detect that in the `sched` function, where we update the PineTime display too.

# Render the¬†Display

_How does CHIP-8 run game programs and render Sprites?_

Think of CHIP-8 as an old-style home computer from the 1980s. It executes simple 8-bit Instructions (Opcodes), reading and writing data to CPU registers and RAM.

CHIP-8 has a unique Instruction that's not found in computers from the 1980s... An Instruction that __renders Sprites.__ Since CHIP-8 renders Sprites as an CHIP-8 Instruction, we should update the PineTime screen only when the CHIP-8 Instruction has completed.

The CHIP-8 Emulator provides a convenient hook for that... It calls `sched` after executing every CHIP-8 Instruction...

```rust
impl libchip8::Hardware for Hardware {
    /// Called in every step; return true for shutdown.
    fn sched(&mut self) -> bool {
        //  If no screen update, return
        if self.update_left == 0 && self.update_right == 0 &&
            self.update_top == 0 && self.update_bottom == 0 { return false; }

        //  If emulator is preparing the initial screen, refresh the screen later
        if !self.is_interactive { return false; }

        //  If emulator is not ready to accept input, refresh the screen later
        if !self.is_checking_input { return false; }
        self.is_checking_input = false;

        //  Tickle the watchdog so that the Watchdog Timer doesn't expire. Mynewt assumes the process is hung if we don't tickle the watchdog.
        unsafe { hal_watchdog_tickle() };

        //  Sleep a while to allow other tasks to run, e.g. SPI background task
        unsafe { os::os_time_delay(1) };

        //  Render the updated region
        render_region(
            self.update_left,
            self.update_top,
            self.update_right,
            self.update_bottom
        );

        //  Reset the screen region to be updated
        self.update_left   = 0;
        self.update_top    = 0;
        self.update_right  = 0;
        self.update_bottom = 0;

        //  Return false to indicate no shutdown
        false
    }
```
_From https://github.com/lupyuen/pinetime-rust-mynewt/blob/master/rust/app/src/chip8.rs#L231-L268_

Instead of updating the entire PineTime display, we update only the rectangular portion that has been changed, by calling `render_region`.

_(Recall that screen updates are tracked by `vram_set`)_

Updating the PineTime display really slows down the CHIP-8 Emulator, so we defer all display updates until absolutely necessary.

_When is it absolutely necessary to update the PineTime display?_

_That's when the game has rendered something and is checking whether the player has pressed any buttons_

Thus we have these conditions to defer the PineTime display updates in `sched`...

```rust
//  If emulator is preparing the initial screen, refresh the screen later
if !self.is_interactive { return false; }

//  If emulator is not ready to accept input, refresh the screen later
if !self.is_checking_input { return false; }
self.is_checking_input = false;
```
_From https://github.com/lupyuen/pinetime-rust-mynewt/blob/master/rust/app/src/chip8.rs#L231-L268_

`is_interactive` and `is_checking_input` are flags set in the `key` function, which is called whenever the CHIP-8 Emulator is checking for button presses.

These simple conditions for defering the PineTime rendering are extremely effective. They make the PineTime CHIP-8 Emulator refresh some screens quicker than other versions of the CHIP-8 Emulator.

_(Compare the loading screen for Blinky on PineTime vs other platforms)_

# Render a¬†Region

Previously in `sched` we have identified the rectangular region of the PineTime display to be updated. We could call `render_block` to render the entire region to the PineTime display in a __single SPI operation__ like this...

```rust
/// Render the Virtual Screen region
fn render_region(left: u8, top: u8, right: u8, bottom: u8) {
    //  Get the physical bounding box width and height
    let physical_box    = get_bounding_box(left, top, right, bottom);  //  Returns (left,top,right,bottom)
    let physical_width  = (physical_box.2 - physical_box.0 + 1) as usize;
    let physical_height = (physical_box.3 - physical_box.1 + 1) as usize;
    //  If the update region is small, render with a single block
    if physical_width + physical_height <= (BLOCK_WIDTH * PIXEL_WIDTH) + (BLOCK_HEIGHT * PIXEL_HEIGHT) {  //  Will not overflow SPI buffer
        render_block(left, top, right, bottom);
    } else {
        ...
```
_From https://github.com/lupyuen/pinetime-rust-mynewt/blob/master/rust/app/src/chip8.rs#L271-L304_

_...But it won't always work!_

Our Rust display driver for PineTime has a buffer size of __8 KB.__

Since one pixel on the PineTime display has 16-bit colour, that means we can (roughly) transmit at most __4,096 pixels in a single SPI operation.__

_If we need to update the __entire CHIP-8 Emulator screen__, how many pixels would we need to transmit?_

```rust
/// CHIP8 Physical Screen size, in Physical Pixels
const PHYSICAL_WIDTH:  usize = 240;
const PHYSICAL_HEIGHT: usize = 200;

/// CHIP8 Virtual Screen size, in Virtual Pixels
const SCREEN_WIDTH:  usize = 64;
const SCREEN_HEIGHT: usize = 32;

/// CHIP8 Virtual Pixel size, in Physical Pixels
const PIXEL_WIDTH:  usize = 3;  //  One Virtual Pixel = 3 x 5 Physical Pixels
const PIXEL_HEIGHT: usize = 5;
```
_From https://github.com/lupyuen/pinetime-rust-mynewt/blob/master/rust/app/src/chip8.rs#L19-L37_

To update the entite CHIP-8 display, we would need to transmit __48,000 pixels__ over SPI (`PHYSICAL_WIDTH` * `PHYSICAL_HEIGHT`)... Waaaaay too many pixels!

_Why so many pixels? Isn't the CHIP-8 screen size only 64 x 32? (`SCREEN_WIDTH` by `SCREEN_HEIGHT`)_

Yeah but we need to __stretch every CHIP-8 Virtual Pixel into 15 PineTime Physical Pixels__ to fill the PineTime display!

_(That's 3 * 5... `PIXEL_WIDTH` * `PIXEL_HEIGHT`)_

Unfortunately the PineTime display controller (ST7789) doesn't handle stretching, so we need to do the stretching ourselves.

_(But fret not... There's something interesting we shall see later... We can do curved stretching! Just like making pizza or roti prata!)_

Thus to prevent the SPI buffer from overflowing, we update the screen in blocks of 32 by 5 Virtual Pixels on CHIP-8... (Or 96 by 25 Physical Pixels on the PineTime display)

```rust
/// CHIP8 Virtual Block size. We render the CHIP8 Virtual Screen in blocks of Virtual Pixels, without overflowing the SPI buffer.
/// PendingDataSize in SPI is 8192. (BLOCK_WIDTH * PIXEL_WIDTH * BLOCK_HEIGHT * PIXEL_HEIGHT) * 2 must be less than PendingDataSize
const BLOCK_WIDTH:  usize = 32;
const BLOCK_HEIGHT: usize = 5;  //  Letter height
```
_From https://github.com/lupyuen/pinetime-rust-mynewt/blob/master/rust/app/src/chip8.rs#L27-L33_

_(Hmmm there's something wrong with the math here...)_

Here's how we break the rendering region into smaller blocks to be rendered by `render_block`...

```rust
/// Render the Virtual Screen region
fn render_region(left: u8, top: u8, right: u8, bottom: u8) {
    ...
    //  If the update region is small, render with a single block
    if physical_width + physical_height <= (BLOCK_WIDTH * PIXEL_WIDTH) + (BLOCK_HEIGHT * PIXEL_HEIGHT) {
        ...
    } else {
        //  If the update region is too big for a single block, break the region into blocks and render
        let mut x = left;
        let mut y = top;
        loop {
            let block_right  = (x + BLOCK_WIDTH as u8 - 1).min(right);
            let block_bottom = (y + BLOCK_HEIGHT as u8 - 1).min(bottom);

            let physical_box    = get_bounding_box(left, top, right, bottom);  //  Returns (left,top,right,bottom)
            let physical_width  = (physical_box.2 - physical_box.0 + 1) as usize;
            let physical_height = (physical_box.3 - physical_box.1 + 1) as usize;
            render_block(x, y,
                block_right,
                block_bottom
            );  //  Will not overflow SPI buffer
            x += BLOCK_WIDTH as u8;
            if x > right {
                x = left;
                y += BLOCK_HEIGHT as u8;
                if y > bottom { break; }
            }
        }
    }
}
```
_From https://github.com/lupyuen/pinetime-rust-mynewt/blob/master/rust/app/src/chip8.rs#L271-L304_

The function `get_bounding_box(left, top, right, bottom)` simply returns a Rust tuple `(left, top, right, bottom)` that may be accessed by using the `.0`, `.1`, `.2` and `.3` notation (shown above like `physical_box.0`).

`get_bounding_box` doesn't do much now... But it will become very interesting later when we stretch the CHIP-8 pixels in a curvy way.

_(Oh yes I love Rust tuples! As much as roti prata!)_

# Render a¬†Block

Now we're ready to render a block of CHIP-8 Virtual Pixels (that has been checked by `render_region` and won't overflow the SPI buffer)...

```rust
/// Render the Virtual Block
fn render_block(left: u8, top: u8, right: u8, bottom: u8) {
    //  Create an iterator for the Physical Pixels to be rendered
    let mut block = PixelIterator::new(
        left, top, 
        right, bottom,
    );
    //  Get the Physical Pixel dimensions of the Virtual Pixels
    let (left_physical, top_physical, right_physical, bottom_physical) = block.get_window();
    //  Render the block via the iterator
    druid::set_display_pixels(left_physical as u16, top_physical as u16, right_physical as u16, bottom_physical as u16,
        &mut block
    ).expect("set pixels failed");    
}
```
_From https://github.com/lupyuen/pinetime-rust-mynewt/blob/master/rust/app/src/chip8.rs#L306-L319_

_Rendering a block of CHIP-8 Virtual Pixels looks suspiciously simple... What's an Iterator?_

A Rust Iterator loops over individual values in a sequence of values. (It's often used in `for` loops)

Here we create a Rust Iterator that loops over individual Physical PineTime Pixels to be rendered (based on the Virtual CHIP-8 Block that's passed in).

The values returned by the Rust Iterator are 16-bit colour values. Our Rust display driver for PineTime calls the Rust Iterator to enumerate all the 16-bit colour values and blast all values in a single SPI operation. Super efficient!

# Iterate Pixels in a¬†Block

Here's the implementation of our iterator that enumerates all Physical Pixel Colours within a Virtual Pixel Block that's defined by the Virtual `(x, y)` Coordinates from `(block_left, block_top)` to `(block_right, block_bottom)`...

```rust
/// Implement the Iterator for Virtual Pixels in a Virtual Block
impl Iterator for PixelIterator {
    /// This Iterator returns Physical Pixel colour words (16-bit)
    type Item = u16;

    /// Return the next Physical Pixel colour
    #[cfg(not(feature = "chip8_curve"))]  //  If we are not rendering CHIP8 Emulator as curved surface...
    fn next(&mut self) -> Option<Self::Item> {
        if self.y > self.block_bottom { return None; }  //  No more Physical Pixels

        //  Get the 16-bit Physical Colour for the Virtual Pixel at (x, y)
        let color = self.get_color();

        //  Update (x, y) to the next pixel left to right, then top to bottom...
        //  Loop over every stretched horizontal Physical Pixel (x_offset) from 0 to PIXEL_WIDTH - 1
        self.x_offset += 1;
        if self.x_offset >= PIXEL_WIDTH as u8 {
            self.x_offset = 0;

            //  Loop over every Virtual Pixel (x) from block_left to block_right
            self.x += 1;
            if self.x > self.block_right {
                self.x = self.block_left;

                //  Loop over every stretched vertical Vertical Pixel (y_offset) from 0 to PIXEL_HEIGHT - 1
                self.y_offset += 1;
                if self.y_offset >= PIXEL_HEIGHT as u8 {
                    self.y_offset = 0;

                    //  Loop over every Virtual Pixel (y) from block_top to block_bottom
                    self.y += 1;
                }
            }
        }
        //  Return the Physical Pixel color
        return Some(color);
    }
```
_From https://github.com/lupyuen/pinetime-rust-mynewt/blob/master/rust/app/src/chip8.rs#L408-L455_

The Iterator returns the next Physical Pixel Colour, as defined by `self.x` (Current Virtual Column) and `self.y` (Current Virtual Row). 

Let's look at function `get_color`, which maps greyscale CHIP-8 Virtual Colours to 16-bit PineTime Physical Colours...

# Convert Colours

CHIP-8 doesn't support colour... Everything is rendered in black and white... Only Two Shades of Grey!

_What if we spice up CHIP-8 games with a dash of colour? How shall we colourise a CHIP-8 game that doesn't know anything about colour?_

By hooking on to the `key` function, we know when the game is first seeking input... Everything that the game renders after startup and up till the first call to `key` is most likely the Initial Loading Screen. 

Thus in the `key` function we flag `is_interactive` as `true` at the first call to `key`.

```rust
impl libchip8::Hardware for Hardware {
    /// Check if the key is pressed.
    fn key(&mut self, key: u8) -> bool {
        //  key is 0-9 for keys "0" to "9", 0xa-0xf to keys "A" to "F"
        if !self.is_interactive {
            self.is_interactive = true;
        }
        self.is_checking_input = true;
        //  Compare the key with the last touch event
        if unsafe { KEY_PRESSED == Some(key) } {
            unsafe { KEY_PRESSED = None };  //  Clear the touch event
            return true;
        }
        false
    }
```
_From https://github.com/lupyuen/pinetime-rust-mynewt/blob/master/rust/app/src/chip8.rs#L133-L147_

_Since we can identify the Initial Loading Screen... Let's colour that screen!_

Remember this code from `vram_set`?

```rust
//  color is true when emulator draws a white pixel, black otherwise
unsafe { SCREEN_BUFFER[i] = 
    if color {                          //  If emulator draws a white pixel...
        if self.is_interactive { 255 }  //  Brighter colour when emulator is active
        else { 200 }                    //  Darker colour for initial screen
    } 
    else {                              //  If emulator draws a black pixel...
        ...
```
_From https://github.com/lupyuen/pinetime-rust-mynewt/blob/master/rust/app/src/chip8.rs#L169-L198_

Instead of plain black and white, our CHIP-8 Virtual Screen Buffer now stores 8-bit greyscale... 256 Shades of Grey!

Through the `is_interactive` flag, we may now paint the Initial Loading Screen as greyscale `200`. Other pixels drawn after the Initial Loading Screen will be set to greyscale `255`.

Greyscale `200` is converted into a greenish hue, while greyscale `255` is converted to bright white...

```rust
/// Convert the Virtual Colour (8-bit greyscale) to 16-bit Physical Pixel Colour
fn convert_color(grey: u8) -> u16 {
    match grey {
        250..=255 => Rgb565::from(( grey,       grey, grey )).0,        //  White
        128..250  => Rgb565::from(( grey - 100, grey, grey - 100 )).0,  //  Greenish
        0..128    => Rgb565::from(( 0,          0,    grey )).0,        //  Dark Blue
    }
}
```
_From https://github.com/lupyuen/pinetime-rust-mynewt/blob/master/rust/app/src/chip8.rs#L494-L510_

_Note that `128..250` means 128 to 249, excluding 250. Whereas `250..=255` means 250 to 255 (inclusive)_

The above function `convert_color` is called by `get_color` to map CHIP-8 Virtual Pixel Greyscale into 16-bit Physical Pixel Colour when rendering every pixel...

```rust
impl PixelIterator {
    /// Return the 16-bit colour of the Virtual Pixel
    fn get_color(&mut self) -> u16 {
        //  Get the greyscale colour at Virtual Coordinates (x,y) and convert to 16-bit Physical Colour
        let i = self.x as usize + self.y as usize * SCREEN_WIDTH;
        let color = unsafe { convert_color( SCREEN_BUFFER[i] ) };
        //  Update the greyscale colour at Virtual Coordinates (x,y)
        if self.x_offset == 0 && self.y_offset == 0 {  //  Update colours only once per Virtual Pixel
            unsafe { SCREEN_BUFFER[i] = update_color( SCREEN_BUFFER[i] ); }  //  e.g. fade to black
        }
        color  //  Return the 16-bit Physical Colour
    }    
}
```

Thus our Initial Loading Screen now looks green. Other Sprites in the game will appear as white (greyscale `255`) because they are rendered after the game has started seeking button input.

This colouring effect is most obvious in the Space Invaders title screen.

_Space Invaders title screen in green_

What about black pixels? Recall the code from `vram_set`...

```rust
//  color is true when emulator draws a white pixel, black otherwise
unsafe { SCREEN_BUFFER[i] = 
    if color {                          //  If emulator draws a white pixel...
        ...
    } 
    else {                              //  If emulator draws a black pixel...
        if self.is_interactive { 127 }  //  Fade to black
        else { 0 }                      //  Black for initial screen                 
    }  
};
```
_From https://github.com/lupyuen/pinetime-rust-mynewt/blob/master/rust/app/src/chip8.rs#L169-L198_

Assuming that the game is actually running (after showing the Initial Loading Screen), `is_interactive` is flagged as true.

The above code sets the CHIP-8 Virtual Pixel to greyscale `127`. Which is mapped by `convert_color` to a dark blue colour...

```rust
/// Convert the Virtual Colour (8-bit greyscale) to 16-bit Physical Pixel Colour
fn convert_color(grey: u8) -> u16 {
    match grey {
        250..=255 => Rgb565::from(( grey,       grey, grey )).0,        //  White
        128..250  => Rgb565::from(( grey - 100, grey, grey - 100 )).0,  //  Greenish
        0..128    => Rgb565::from(( 0,          0,    grey )).0,        //  Dark Blue
    }
}

/// Fade the Virtual Colour (8-bit greyscale) to black
fn update_color(grey: u8) -> u8 {
    match grey {
        200..=255 => grey - 2,    //  Initial white flash fade to normal white
        128..200  => grey,        //  Normal white stays the same
        0..128    => grey >> 1,   //  Dark fade to black
    }
}
```
_From https://github.com/lupyuen/pinetime-rust-mynewt/blob/master/rust/app/src/chip8.rs#L494-L510_

Note that the `update_color` function above is also called by `get_color` while rendering each pixel of the PineTime display.

`update_color` gradually diminishes greyscale `127` until it reaches `0`, at every rendering of the pixel. (`>>1` shifts the greyscale right by 1 bit, which is the same as dividing by 2)

The result: Black pixels appear as dark blue trails that fade to black.

This colouring effect is most obvious in the Pong game... Watch the trail of the bouncing ball.

# Handle Touch Events

CHIP-8 uses a keypad with 15 keys, marked `0` to `9`, `A` to `F`.

For PineTime we'll emulate a simple keypad: Tapping the Left part of the touchscreen simulates the key `4`, Centre part simulates `5`, Right part simulates `6`.

This is sufficient for playing Space Invaders, which uses `4` and `6` to move your spaceship Left and Right, and `5` to fire.

Function `handle_touch` is called by the PineTime Rust touch controller driver with the `(x,y)` coordinates of the touched point, from `(0,0)` to `(239,239)`...

```rust
/// Handle touch events to emulate buttons
pub fn handle_touch(x: u16, _y: u16) { 
    //  We only handle 3 keys: 4, 5, 6, which correspond to Left, Centre, Right
    let key =                                                  //  PHYSICAL_WIDTH is 240
        if x < PHYSICAL_WIDTH as u16 / 3 { Some(4) }           //  Left = 4
        else if x < 2 * PHYSICAL_WIDTH as u16 / 3 { Some(5) }  //  Centre = 5
        else { Some(6) };                                      //  Right = 6
    unsafe { KEY_PRESSED = key };
}

/// Represents the key pressed: 0-9 for keys "0" to "9", 0xa-0xf to keys "A" to "F", None for nothing pressed
static mut KEY_PRESSED: Option<u8> = None;
```
_From https://github.com/lupyuen/pinetime-rust-mynewt/blob/master/rust/app/src/chip8.rs#L133-L147_

`handle_touch` stores the simulated keypress into `KEY_PRESSED`

Note that `KEY_PRESSED` has type `Option<u8>`, which is an optional unsigned byte. So `KEY_PRESSED` may contain a specified byte (like `Some(4)`), or nothing (`None`).

The CHIP-8 Emulator checks for keys pressed by calling the `key` function...

```rust
impl libchip8::Hardware for Hardware {
    /// Check if the key is pressed.
    fn key(&mut self, key: u8) -> bool {
        //  key is 0-9 for keys "0" to "9", 0xa-0xf to keys "A" to "F"
        if !self.is_interactive {
            self.is_interactive = true;
        }
        self.is_checking_input = true;
        //  Compare the key with the last touch event
        if unsafe { KEY_PRESSED == Some(key) } {
            unsafe { KEY_PRESSED = None };  //  Clear the touch event
            return true;
        }
        false
    }
```
_From https://github.com/lupyuen/pinetime-rust-mynewt/blob/master/rust/app/src/chip8.rs#L492-L504_

When the Emulator calls `key(self, 4)`, we should return `true` if the key `4` has been pressed, i.e. `KEY_PRESSED` has value `Some(4)`

This doesn't found efficient for checking many keys... But it's probably OK for retro games.

# CHIP-8 Emulator Task

The CHIP-8 Emulator blocks and doesn't return when we call its `run` function. PineTime needs multitasking to refresh the display (via SPI) and to accept touchscreen input, so we need to start a Background Task for the emulator...

```rust
/// Erase the PineTime display and start the CHIP-8 Emulator task
pub fn on_start() -> MynewtResult<()> {
    //  Create black background
    let background = Rectangle::<Rgb565>
        ::new( Coord::new( 0, 0 ), Coord::new( 239, 239 ) )   //  Rectangle coordinates
        .fill( Some( Rgb565::from(( 0x00, 0x00, 0x00 )) ) );  //  Black

    //  Render background to display
    druid::draw_to_display(background);

    //  Start the emulator in a background task
    os::task_init(                  //  Create a new task and start it...
        unsafe { &mut CHIP8_TASK }, //  Task object will be saved here
        &init_strn!( "chip8" ),     //  Name of task
        Some( task_func ),    //  Function to execute when task starts
        NULL,  //  Argument to be passed to above function
        20,    //  Task priority: highest is 0, lowest is 255 (main task is 127), SPI is 10
        os::OS_WAIT_FOREVER as u32,       //  Don't do sanity / watchdog checking
        unsafe { &mut CHIP8_TASK_STACK }, //  Stack space for the task
        CHIP8_TASK_STACK_SIZE as u16      //  Size of the stack (in 4-byte units)
    ) ? ;                                 //  `?` means check for error

    //  Return success to the caller
    Ok(())
}

/// CHIP8 Background Task
static mut CHIP8_TASK: os::os_task = fill_zero!(os::os_task);

/// Stack space for CHIP8 Task, initialised to 0.
static mut CHIP8_TASK_STACK: [os::os_stack_t; CHIP8_TASK_STACK_SIZE] = 
    [0; CHIP8_TASK_STACK_SIZE];

/// Size of the stack (in 4-byte units). Previously `OS_STACK_ALIGN(256)`  
const CHIP8_TASK_STACK_SIZE: usize = 4096;  //  Must be 4096 and above because CHIP8 Emulator requires substantial stack space
```
_From https://github.com/lupyuen/pinetime-rust-mynewt/blob/master/rust/app/src/chip8.rs#L39-L66_

Note that we're using [Apache Mynewt OS](https://mynewt.apache.org/) to manage multitasking on PineTime, so we need to use the Mynewt functions (like `task_init`) for scheduling and synchronising our tasks.

# Build and Run the Emulator

To build the CHIP-8 Emulator for PineTime, edit the Rust configuration file [`rust/app/Cargo.toml`](https://github.com/lupyuen/pinetime-rust-mynewt/blob/master/rust/app/Cargo.toml).

Uncomment the feature `chip8_app` and comment out all other features, like this...

```yaml
[features]
default =  [          # Select the conditional compiled features
    # "display_app",  # Disable graphics display app
    # "ui_app",       # Disable druid UI app
    # "visual_app",   # Disable Visual Rust app
    "chip8_app",      # Enable CHIP8 Emulator app
    # "chip8_curve",  # Uncomment to render CHIP8 Emulator as curved surface (requires chip8_app)
    # "use_float",    # Disable floating-point support e.g. GPS geolocation
]
```
_From https://github.com/lupyuen/pinetime-rust-mynewt/blob/master/rust/app/Cargo.toml_

If you're using the curved rendering feature (explained in the next section), uncomment both `chip8_app` and `chip8_curve`.

Edit the Mynewt configuration file [`apps/my_sensor_app/syscfg.yml`](https://github.com/lupyuen/pinetime-rust-mynewt/blob/master/apps/my_sensor_app/syscfg.yml).

Set `OS_MAIN_STACK_SIZE` to `2048`...

```yaml
syscfg.vals:
    # OS_MAIN_STACK_SIZE: 1024  #  Small stack size: 4 KB
    OS_MAIN_STACK_SIZE: 2048    #  Normal stack size: 8 KB
    # OS_MAIN_STACK_SIZE: 4096  #  Large stack size: 16 KB
```
_From https://github.com/lupyuen/pinetime-rust-mynewt/blob/master/apps/my_sensor_app/syscfg.yml_

This shrinks the default system stack size and allows us to allocate a larger stack that's needed for the emulator task.

Then build the PineTime firmware according to [the instructions here](https://github.com/lupyuen/pinetime-rust-mynewt/blob/master/README.md).

# Distort the CHIP-8 Rendering

Remember we said earlier that every Virtual Pixel on CHIP-8 is rendered as a rectangular chunk of 15 Physical Pixels on the PineTime display. (Because we need to stretch the pixel to fill the PineTime display)

_Not super efficient... But since we're blasting out 15 pixels anyway... Can we be more creative? What if we blast the 15 pixels in a curvy way like this..._

![Blinky distorted on a curved surface](https://lupyuen.github.io/images/chip8-blinky-curve.jpg)

_Blinky distorted on a curved surface_

This looks interesting... Almost "Organic", like a CRT display protruding from the PineTime screen.  So let's get adventurous! 

_How shall we distort the CHIP-8 Emulator in a curvy way based on this rectangular grid..._

![Blinky without distortion](https://lupyuen.github.io/images/chip8-blinky.jpg)

_Blinky without distortion... See how the distorted version fills the entire display width nicely? That's the power of distortion!_

Mathematically we are mapping a __Square (the CHIP-8 output) to a Sphere (the curved rendering surface)__ like this...

![Distorting CHIP-8 on a curved surface](https://lupyuen.github.io/images/chip8-curve.jpg)

_From https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18264703/mapping-a-2d-grid-onto-a-sphere_

The obvious approach would be to crack open the Sine and Cosine Functions from our high school textbooks and work out the correct formula... But we shall do no such boring things here!

Let's look at __3D Interpolation__ instead.  I have a strong hunch that...

1. Calling `sin` and `cos` at every pixel rendering would be too taxing on our nRF52 microcontroller

1. We have plenty of ROM on PineTime (512 KB). Perfect for our nRF52 microcontroller to look up simple __Lookup Tables__ that will map Virtual Pixel to Physical Pixels and vice versa.  

1. How will the Lookup Tables work? Given a Virtual Pixel on CHIP-8, we need to find out the corresponding Physical Pixels on the curvy PineTime display. 

1. And the Lookup Tables will also tell us the Virtual Pixel that corresponds to each Physical Pixel. (This is a One Virtual Pixel to Multiple Physical Pixel mapping... Mathematically, `1:N`)

1. The PineTime display is only 240x240... Precomputing and storing the Lookup Tables into ROM should be easy. Note that the mapping of Square to Sphere is Symmetric on the X and Y axes. So we only need to compute one quadrant of the mapping! (I chose the lower right quadrant)

1. To compute the Lookup Tables, we'll take a few points from the Square to Sphere mapping and interpolate them (i.e. run a Rust program to fill in the missing pixels between the points).

1. Interpolating the pixels is probably a good idea for the long term... It lets us tweak the mapping manually by shifting the points. (Instead of figuring out complicated math formulae)

# Interpolate the Sphere to Square mapping (Physical ‚Üí Virtual)

_How shall we get the Interpolation Points to map the rectangular Virtual Pixels on CHIP-8 to the curved Physical Pixels on PineTime display? Let's copy them literally from the [Square to Sphere Interpolation Diagram](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18264703/mapping-a-2d-grid-onto-a-sphere_)!_

![Interpolation Points copied from diagram into spreadsheet](https://lupyuen.github.io/images/chip8-points.png)

_Interpolation Points copied from diagram into spreadsheet. From https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1G9kLS0Es6kwcMA3SC50w5-T-LBYi3NQeY98y7HOAovs/edit#gid=0_

This produces 49 curved Intepolation Points (7 * 7) that we shall map into a rectangular grid for CHIP-8. As shown in the top left corner of [the spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1G9kLS0Es6kwcMA3SC50w5-T-LBYi3NQeY98y7HOAovs/edit#gid=0)...

- `(586, 105)` on the curved PineTime surface, normalised to `(-99, -84)`, maps to normalised `(-32, -16)` on CHIP-8

- `(618, 95)` on the curved PineTime surface, normalised to `(-65, -93)`, maps to normalised `(-21, -16)` on CHIP-8

- `(574, 137)` on the curved PineTime surface, normalised to `(-112, -56)`, maps to normalised `(-32, -11)` on CHIP-8

_We normalise Physical PineTime Pixels on the curved surface to fall within (-120, -100) to (120, 100)... And Virtual CHIP-8 Pixels within (-32, -16) to (32, 16)_

But since X and Y are Symmetric in the mapping, we'll consider only the lower right quadrant of the spreadsheet...

- Normalised `(1, 0)` on the curved PineTime surface maps to normalised `(0, 0)` on CHIP-8

- Normalised `(45, 0)` on the curved PineTime surface maps to normalised `(11, 0)` on CHIP-8

- Normalised `(1, 36)` on the curved PineTime surface maps to normalised `(0, 5)` on CHIP-8

We're now ready to interpolate the missing Physical and Virtual Pixels. We'll feed the above numbers to the __[[spade] crate]([https://crates.io/crates/spade])__ for interpolation, in two steps.

We'll feed the numbers for PineTime Physical (X, Y) ‚Üí CHIP-8 Virtual X first...

```rust
#[cfg(feature = "interpolate_x")]  //  If interpolating X values...
fn load_data() -> [Point3<f64>; 16] {
    [
        //  Generated by https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1G9kLS0Es6kwcMA3SC50w5-T-LBYi3NQeY98y7HOAovs/edit#gid=1875321785
        p( 1 as f64,  0 as f64,  0 as f64),  //  Physical ( 1,  0) ‚Üí Virtual X =  0
        p(45 as f64,  0 as f64, 11 as f64),  //  Physical (45,  0) ‚Üí Virtual X = 11
        p( 1 as f64, 36 as f64,  0 as f64),  //  Physical ( 1, 36) ‚Üí Virtual X =  0
        ...
```
_From https://github.com/lupyuen/interpolate-surface/blob/master/src/delaunay_creation.rs_

Then PineTime Physical (X, Y) ‚Üí CHIP-8 Virtual Y...

```rust
#[cfg(feature = "interpolate_y")]  //  If interpolating Y values...
fn load_data() -> [Point3<f64>; 16] {
    [
        //  Generated by https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1G9kLS0Es6kwcMA3SC50w5-T-LBYi3NQeY98y7HOAovs/edit#gid=1875321785
        p( 1 as f64,  0 as f64, 0 as f64),  //  Physical ( 1,  0) ‚Üí Virtual Y = 0
        p(45 as f64,  0 as f64, 0 as f64),  //  Physical (45,  0) ‚Üí Virtual Y = 0
        p( 1 as f64, 36 as f64, 5 as f64),  //  Physical ( 1, 36) ‚Üí Virtual Y = 5
        ...
```
_From https://github.com/lupyuen/interpolate-surface/blob/master/src/delaunay_creation.rs_

We'll use __[Natural Neighbor 3D Interpolation](https://stoeoef.gitbooks.io/spade-user-manual/content/interpolation.html)__ from the [spade] crate to interpolate the missing Virtual (X, Y) pixels, in two steps (Virtual X then Virtual Y).

_Why is this considered 3D Interpolation, not 2D Interpolation? Because we are mapping two numbers (Physical X = 1, Physical Y = 0) to a third number (Virtual X = 0)_

It sounds like a miracle, but the [[spade] 3D Interpolation Program](https://github.com/lupyuen/interpolate-surface) will produce smoothly-interpolated CHIP-8 Virtual X values for __every single PineTime pixel of Physical (X, Y)__ from (0, 0) to (120, 100)... (That's the lower right quadrant)

```
Physical ( 1,  0) -> Virtual X =  0  //  Provided value
Physical ( 2,  0) -> Virtual X =  0  //  Interpolated value
Physical ( 3,  0) -> Virtual X =  1  //  Interpolated value
...
Physical (45,  1) -> Virtual X = 11  //  Provided value
Physical (46,  1) -> Virtual X = 11  //  Interpolated value
Physical (47,  1) -> Virtual X = 11  //  Interpolated value
...
Physical ( 1, 36) -> Virtual X =  0  //  Provided value
Physical ( 2, 36) -> Virtual X =  0  //  Interpolated value
Physical ( 3, 36) -> Virtual X =  1  //  Interpolated value
...
```
_Output of [interpolate-surface program](https://github.com/lupyuen/interpolate-surface). From https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1G9kLS0Es6kwcMA3SC50w5-T-LBYi3NQeY98y7HOAovs/edit#gid=1436721555_

The program will also produce smoothly-interpolated CHIP-8 Virtual Y values for every single PineTime pixel of Physical (X, Y) in the lower right quadrant. (Need to edit `Cargo.toml` and select the feature `interpolate_y`)

So mapping from every Physical Pixel on the curved PineTime display to Virtual Pixel on CHIP-8 is complete!

# Interpolate the Square to Sphere mapping (Virtual ‚Üí Physical)

Now let's map every Virtual Pixel on CHIP-8 to Physical Pixels on the curved PineTime display.

Fortunately there's no need to use 3D Interpolation here... We'll simply search for all Physical Pixels that correspond to each Virtual Pixel, using the Physical ‚Üí Virtual mapping that we have created earlier.

_(Remember that Physical Pixels range from (0, 0) to (120, 100), so the search should be quite fast on a desktop computer)_

Here's how we find all Physical Pixels that are mapped from each Virtual Pixel...

```rust
/// Given a grid of Physical (x,y) Coordinates and their interpolated Virtual (x,y) Coordinates, 
/// find all Physical (x,y) Coordinates that interpolate to (x_virtual,y_virtual).
/// Return the (left, top, right, bottom) of the Bounding Box that encloses these found points.
/// x_virtual and y_virtual are truncated to integer during comparison.
/// Function returns `None` if (x_virtual,y_virtual) was not found.
fn get_bounding_box(
    x_virtual_grid: &[[f64; X_PHYSICAL_SUBDIVISIONS + 1]; Y_PHYSICAL_SUBDIVISIONS + 1],
    y_virtual_grid: &[[f64; X_PHYSICAL_SUBDIVISIONS + 1]; Y_PHYSICAL_SUBDIVISIONS + 1],
    x_virtual: f64,
    y_virtual: f64
) -> Option<(f64, f64, f64, f64)> {
    let mut left: f64 = f64::MAX;
    let mut top: f64 = f64::MAX;
    let mut right: f64 = f64::MIN;
    let mut bottom: f64 = f64::MIN;
    //  For all Physical (x,y) Coordinates...
    for y in 0..=Y_PHYSICAL_SUBDIVISIONS {
        for x in 0..=X_PHYSICAL_SUBDIVISIONS {
            //  Get the Physical (x,y) Coordinates
            let pos = transform_physical_point(cg::Point2::new(x as f64, y as f64));

            //  Get the interpolated Virtual (x,y) Coordinates
            let x_interpolated = x_virtual_grid[y][x].floor();
            let y_interpolated = y_virtual_grid[y][x].floor();

            //  Skip if not matching
            if x_interpolated as u8 != x_virtual as u8 || 
                y_interpolated as u8 != y_virtual as u8 { continue; }

            //  Find the Bounding Box of the Physical (x,y) Coordinates
            if pos.x < left   { left   = pos.x; }
            if pos.y < top    { top    = pos.y; }
            if pos.x > right  { right  = pos.x; }
            if pos.y > bottom { bottom = pos.y; }
        }
    };
    if left < f64::MAX && top < f64::MAX &&
        right > f64::MIN && bottom > f64::MIN {  //  (x_virtual,y_virtual) found
            Some((left.floor(), top.floor(), right.floor(), bottom.floor())) 
    } else { None }  //  (x_virtual,y_virtual) not found
}
```
_From https://github.com/lupyuen/interpolate-surface/blob/master/src/main.rs#L297-L337_

Each CHIP-8 Virtual Pixel may map to one or more PineTime Physical Pixels. Instead of returning all matching Physical Pixels, we return the Physical Bounding Box instead... The Physical Bounding Box at Physical Coordinates (Left, Top) to (Right, Bottom) is the smallest box that contains all the matching Physical Pixels.

The above function `get_bounding_box` is called like this for every Virtual CHIP-8 Pixel...

```rust
/// For all Virtual (x,y) Coordinates, compute the Bounding Box that encloses the corresponding Physical (x,y) Coordinates.
/// Used by the CHIP-8 Emulator to decide which Physical Pixels to redraw when a Virtual Pixel is updated.
fn generate_virtual_to_physical_map() {
    println!("VIRTUAL_TO_PHYSICAL_MAP=");
    print!("[");
    for y in 0..Y_VIRTUAL_SUBDIVISIONS {
        print!("[");
        for x in 0..X_VIRTUAL_SUBDIVISIONS {
            //  Convert the normalised (x,y) into Virtual (x,y) Coordinates
            let pos = transform_virtual_point(cg::Point2::new(x as f64, y as f64));
            //  For all Physical (x,y) that interpolate to the Virtual (x,y), find the bounding box
            let bounding_box = get_bounding_box(

Thus the above function `generate_virtual_to_physical_map` computes the mapping: CHIP-8 Virtual Pixel ‚Üí PineTime Physical Bounding Box. And produces the `VIRTUAL_TO_PHYSICAL_MAP` Lookup Table.

The other Lookup Table `PHYSICAL_TO_VIRTUAL_MAP` is produced by the function `generate_physical_to_virtual_map`...

```rust
/// For all Physical (x,y) Coordinates, return the corresponding Virtual (x,y) Coordinates.
/// Used by the CHIP-8 Emulator to decide which Virtual Pixel to fetch the colour value when rendering a Physical Pixel.

We'll peek at the contents of Lookup Tables `PHYSICAL_TO_VIRTUAL_MAP` and `VIRTUAL_TO_PHYSICAL_MAP` in a while.

# Validate the Square to Sphere Interpolation

_Why did we choose Natural Neighbor Interpolation? (Even though I'm no expert at 3D Interpolation?)_

Amazingly, the [spade] crate includes an awesome feature to visualise the 3D Interpolated points... in 3D! Run [`interpolate_surface`](https://github.com/lupyuen/interpolate-surface), press and hold the Left Mouse Button to rotate the 3D view, press and hold the right Mouse Button to move the 3D view.

The `interpolate_surface` program includes [multiple 3D Interpolation methods](https://stoeoef.gitbooks.io/spade-user-manual/content/interpolation.html). Press `G` to switch 3D Interpolation methods.  Let's compare the first one that appears (Barycentic Interpolation at right) with the second one (Natural Neighbor Interpolation at left)...

![Natural Neighbor Interpolation (left) vs Barycentic Interpolation (right) in 3D perspective](https://lupyuen.github.io/images/chip8-interpolate.png)

_Natural Neighbor Interpolation (left) vs Barycentic Interpolation (right) in 3D perspective. Zoom in to see details. From https://github.com/lupyuen/interpolate-surface_

Recall that we're using (X, Y) coordinates to interpolate a Z value. Which is shown above as the height of each point. (Like hilltops)

Barycentic Interpolation (right) has an unusual kink, so it doesn't look like a smooth interpolation.

Thus we picked Natural Neighbor Interpolation (left), which looks much smoother. This lets us verify visually that our pixels are indeed interpolated smoothly between the given points.

The smooth result of the 3D Interpolation is obvious... Straight lines are gently curved on the PineTime display.  All this interpolated from only __16 points__ in the lower right quadrant!

# Map Physical Pixels to Virtual¬†Pixels

Now that we have precomputed the Lookup Tables `PHYSICAL_TO_VIRTUAL_MAP` and `VIRTUAL_TO_PHYSICAL_MAP`, let's embed them into PineTime's Flash ROM.

Here's how we embed `PHYSICAL_TO_VIRTUAL_MAP`, the array that maps every Physical Pixel to the corresponding Virtual Pixel...

`PHYSICAL_TO_VIRTUAL_MAP` is the Lookup Table precomputed by the `generate_physical_to_virtual_map` function that we have seen earlier. This is a 2D array with 100 rows and 120 columns, covering the Physical Pixels in the lower right quadrant of the PineTime display.

Each element of `PHYSICAL_TO_VIRTUAL_MAP` (indexed by Physical Row and Physical Column) is a tuple (Virtual X, Virtual Y), the coordinates of the mapped Virtual Pixel on CHIP-8.

`map_physical_to_virtual_normalised` is the function used to look up the `PHYSICAL_TO_VIRTUAL_MAP` table by Normalised Physical (X, Y) Coordinates.

`map_physical_to_virtual` is the function that maps the Actual (Unnormalised) Physical (X, Y) Coordinates to the Virtual (X, Y) Coordinates.

This function normalises the coordinates from the four quadrants of the screen into the lower right quadrant. Hence it flips and unflips the coordinates before and after calling `map_physical_to_virtual_normalised`. (Just like roti prata)

# Iterate Curved¬†Pixels

_How shall we use the two Lookup Tables and their access functions `map_physical_to_virtual`, `map_virtual_to_physical`?_

Remember `PixelIterator`, our Rust Iterator that returns a sequence of Physical Pixel Colours (16-bit) that will be rendered for a Physical Block of PineTime pixels?

Here's the updated `PixelIterator` for rendering pixels on a curved surface...

```rust
/// Implement the Iterator for Virtual Pixels in a Virtual Block
impl Iterator for PixelIterator {
    /// This Iterator returns Physical Pixel colour words (16-bit)
    type Item = u16;
    ...    
    /// Return the next Physical Pixel colour
    #[cfg(feature = "chip8_curve")]  //  If we are rendering CHIP8 Emulator as curved surface...
    fn next(&mut self) -> Option<Self::Item> {
        if self.y_physical > self.physical_bottom { return None; }  //  No more Physical Pixels
        assert!(self.x_physical < PHYSICAL_WIDTH as u8, "x overflow");
        assert!(self.y_physical < PHYSICAL_HEIGHT as u8, "y overflow");

        //  Map the Physical Pixel to the Virtual Pixel
        let virtual_pixel = map_physical_to_virtual(self.x_physical, self.y_physical);

        if self.x == virtual_pixel.0 && self.y == virtual_pixel.1 {
            //  If rendering the same Virtual Pixel, increment the offset
            self.x_offset += 1;
        } else {
            //  If rendering a different Virtual Pixel, reset the offset
            self.x = virtual_pixel.0;
            self.y = virtual_pixel.1;
            self.x_offset = 0;
            self.y_offset = 0;
        }

        //  Get the colour from the Virtual Screen Buffer
        let color = self.get_color();

        //  Loop over x_physical from physical_left to physical_right
        self.x_physical += 1;
        if self.x_physical > self.physical_right {
            self.x_physical = self.physical_left;
            //  Loop over y_physical from physical_top to physical_bottom
            self.y_physical += 1;
        }
        
        //  Return the Physical Pixel color
        return Some(color);
    }    
```
_From https://github.com/lupyuen/pinetime-rust-mynewt/blob/master/rust/app/src/chip8.rs#L457-L491_

The new `PixelIterator` steps through each Physical PineTime Pixel in a block and calls `map_physical_to_virtual` to find the corresponding Virtual CHIP-8 Pixel and its colour.

With curved distortion, a Virtual CHIP-8 Pixel no longer maps to a rectangular block of Physical PineTime Pixels... It actually maps to a curved block of Physical Pixels.

To simplify the rendering, we'll just consider the Bounding Box of the Physical Pixels. Which may overlap partially with other Virtual Pixels... But the extra rendering should be fine.

Here's how we get the Bounding Box of Physical Pixels for a Virtual Pixel...

```rust
/// Return Bounding Box of Physical Pixels (left, top, right, bottom) that correspond to the Virtual Pixels
#[cfg(feature = "chip8_curve")]  //  If we are rendering CHIP8 Emulator as curved surface...
fn get_bounding_box(virtual_left: u8, virtual_top: u8, virtual_right: u8, virtual_bottom: u8) -> (u8, u8, u8, u8) {
    //  One Virtual Pixel may map to multiple Physical Pixels, so we lookup the Physical Bounding Box.
    //  TODO: Handle wide and tall Bounding Boxes
    let physical_left_top = map_virtual_to_physical(virtual_left, virtual_top);  //  Returns (left,top,right,bottom)
    let physical_right_bottom = map_virtual_to_physical(virtual_right, virtual_bottom);

    let left: u8 = physical_left_top.0;
    let top: u8 = physical_left_top.1;
    let right: u8 = physical_right_bottom.2.min(PHYSICAL_WIDTH as u8 - 1);
    let bottom: u8 = physical_right_bottom.3.min(PHYSICAL_HEIGHT as u8 - 1);
    assert!(left < PHYSICAL_WIDTH as u8 && top < PHYSICAL_HEIGHT as u8 && right < PHYSICAL_WIDTH as u8 && bottom < PHYSICAL_HEIGHT as u8, "overflow");
    ( left, top, right, bottom )  //  Return the Physical Bounding Box
}
```
_From https://github.com/lupyuen/pinetime-rust-mynewt/blob/master/rust/app/src/chip8.rs#L523-L538_

The above curved version of `get_bounding_box` is called by `render_region` to determine which Physical Pixels need to be redrawn whenever the CHIP-8 screen is updated.

# Lookup Table Size

_Will this curved distortion for CHIP-8 bloat the PineTime firmware size? Will the Lookup Tables for the curved mapping fit comfortably into PineTime's Flash ROM (512 KB)?_

![PineTime Firmware Size without distortion (left) and with curved distortion (right)](https://lupyuen.github.io/images/chip8-size.png)

_PineTime Firmware Size without distortion (left) and with curved distortion (right)_

Amazingly... NO not much bloat, and YES the tables fit into ROM! Only __27 KB__ of Flash ROM was needed to store the Lookup Tables! (No extra RAM needed)

Take a look at the demo video... Rendering CHIP-8 on a curved surface doesn't seem to affect the game performance. Lookup Tables in ROM work really well for curved rendering!
